You play games to have fun, you grind to win. **Winning is fun**, credit card debt is not.

As a F2P Player, It is understandable to get frustrated by P2W. A player who invests money in the game has clear advantages, but so does a **player who keeps playing despite everything.**

**Players who keep playing despite PVP frustrations become veterans.** Veterans are more powerful than 99% of whales. 

The difference in power between F2P Players and whales is (usually) small. The only P2W item that grants any amount of power in this game is a **P2Wand**, and F2P Players can **get one by saving resources and biding their time.**

All players **just want to have fun in PVP**, they only differ in how to pursue that.

## The PVE Grind
>[!quote] "The silver doe burst from the tip of his wand. Not from some lousy stick, not from some 2-Galleon twig, but from the tip of the most magnificent, the most powerful P2Wand the World has ever seen. 'You have been saving,' said Dumbledore in disbelief, 'all this time?'"

F2P Players should play **in a smart way.** PVP is more fun, but **PVE grants most resources.** You should get the **most rewards out of your time.**

**Fun is the most important resource of all,** because of daily, weekly, and monthly caps. The longer you play without getting frustrated, taking breaks, or quitting the game, **the more resources you gather in the long run.** 

**Do not overplay any activity.** Once you hit a daily or weekly cap, move on to something else. Daily, Weekly, and Monthly Caps are barriers between you and power. You should **play around these barriers, not against them.**

Grind should fit the time you're willing to invest in it. Only a **few minutes?** Do daily tasks. **Half an hour?** Add some story missions or team activities. **The ideal grind order is:**

1. Daily Tasks
2. Event, Story, or Side Missions
3. Forbidden Forest
4. Team Activities
6. Co-op Forest (for Thank You Letters)
7. PVP

Monthly goals drive you. You have **the entire month** to reach Hall of Fame, complete the Season Pass, or grind enough resources to afford monthly prizes or the Gacha Wheel. **Pace yourself** to avoid **boredom** and **frustration.**

It's ok to miss your goals, the most important thing is to **come back to grind** the next day. Keep it **fun**, and **power** will come **over time.**

## The F2P Code & Veterans

You either die a **casual**, or play long enough to **become a veteran.** F2P Players do not have to sacrifice much to get there (beside cosmetics). Play smart. **Patience, persistence, discipline** ‚Äî these will go a long way as a F2P Player.

Magic Awakened is not a race, it's more like a **Collect-a-Thon** ‚Äî what matters the most is how many resources you collected by the time you reach the finish line.

That's basically a veteran: **a player who collected many resources and used them well.**

There is a path to power, and that path can be very fun to traverse. It's not all doom and gloom for F2P Players. Remember that **Harry Potter Magic Awakened is incredible, even without a credit card.** 

So, to become a Veteran, follow the **F2P Code:**
