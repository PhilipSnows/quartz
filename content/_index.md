## Introduction
>[!quote] "The player's body turned into his dueling partner, spread-eagled on her back, her eyes wide open and empty. The player sobbed harder than ever. 'R-riddikulus!' he sobbed again. Crack. A whale replaced the body, an absurd amount of HP, basic attacks dealing twice as much damage. 'No!' The player moaned. 'No ... riddikulus! Riddikulus! RIDDIKULUS!' Crack. P2W Wands. Crack. Deck filled with Level 15 Cards. Crack. Max Level Legendary Echos with +3 bonuses ..."

>—Harry Potter and the Cursed Whale 🐳

This guide exists because Hogwarts does not prepare you to face whales in Defense Against the Dark Arts, but it should. With some preparation, **F2P Players can win PVP against whales** and **veterans.**

This is a compendium of tips, advice, memes, and bad jokes. There may be some **general tips** in the guide, but the **focus is on PVP**, and the main target audience are **Free to Play (F2P) Players.**

Most advice here is based on experience with the **Taiwan (TW) Version** of 'Harry Potter: Magic Awakened'. Some content may not apply to the (more Pay to Win) **Global Version.**

The guide is divided in 10 commandments (sections). There is a **summary (TLDR)** of the commandment at the start, and details in the **subsections.**

1. Go to a main section;
2. Skip quotes and memes if you hate fun;
3. Read the content or skip to new links at the bottom of the page.
