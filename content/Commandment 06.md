# 6. You Shall Not Crave Thy Neighbor's Cosmetics

Good resource management skills would allow you to collect a variety of cosmetics, including some premium ones. There is an opportunity-cost for doing so: **you would have to spend resources you could otherwise spend on power.**

The **social aspects of Magic Awakened can put some pressure on you** to chase cosmetics. Dolphins and whales have access to some cool stuff, but this is not an area of the game where F2P Players can compete.

The **grind for power can get boring**, and combined with the inevitable frustration you will (eventually) experience with PVP, you may prefer to **focus on cosmetics to continue having fun.**

Taking a **break from the game** or finding **other ways to have fun** is **better for your progress**, but investing in cosmetics can be fun too. In the end, having fun is the most important thing. **The choice is yours.**

## F2P Vs Whale Cosmetics üê≥

Cosmetics are not a (significant) Pay to Win element of Magic Awakened unless you want it to be. **It's possible for F2P Players to acquire many cosmetics,** but that does not mean you should. Whales are beautiful, you are not ‚Äî and you never will be. Whales are powerful, and you are not ‚Äî yet.

**This guide** aims to give F2P Players a fighting chance against whales and veterans in **PVP Wizarding Duels.** That goal is entirely possible, but it benefits from a **Spartan-like playstyle**, so to speak. That means using your resources to gain power, not cosmetics.

This cannot be repeated often enough: the secret to survive as a F2P Player is **resource management.** Always. Most whale cosmetics can only be acquired using the **same resources you could spend on power.**

That said, **enjoyment of the game is more important than power.** If you are absolutely sure it is more fun to have **some** whale cosmetics instead of power: know that you can.

## How F2P Players Buy Whale Cosmetics üê≥

Most cosmetics can be acquired using [[Commandment 07#Gems|Gems]] or [[Commandment 07#Event Currency|Event Currencies.]] You can **hoard** such resources and **wait for an opportunity.**

**The best cosmetics are time-limited,** to generate **FOMO.** You will **not** be able to save enough resources **between the time a cosmetic appears and the time it disappears.**

When you buy cosmetics, be sure it is something you really want, because **F2P Players cannot afford to buy cosmetics every month.**

You need time to hoard. It takes around **two months worth of saving gems** to buy 60 [[Commandment 07#Clockturn Keys|Clockturn Keys.]]

And the initial advice remains: you should ignore cosmetics and **focus on power instead.**

## Collection Points üê≥

Like an abused house elf, you should wear your rags with pride. **Be thankful for whatever free cosmetic** you can get your filthy little hands upon.

The **Collection Attribute** you find in cosmetics has two functions: **to upgrade your Wizard Space (room)** and buff your **Exploration Attributes.**

Once you have enough Collection Points, your Wizard Space is upgraded. **Each upgrade makes your room larger and gives you access to more decorations** to show off your fashion sense and interior decoration skills.

A bonus to Exploration Attribute is very good for resource gathering, but **cosmetics are too expensive.** You could spend all your Gold, all your Gems, and your entire bank account, and the only **gameplay advantage** you'd have in return is **that bonus.**

It's a decent bonus, but **you could upgrade a lot of cards using the same resources.** Collection Points are too costly, so you should **ignore cosmetics if your focus is PVP.** 

Your room will **grow slowly with F2P cosmetics** anyway. Give preference to Cosmetics with **High Collection Points** to grow your room quicker.
