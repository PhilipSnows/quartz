# 8. You Shall Use Meta Decks

Unlike many Collectible Card Games (CCG), you can acquire every card in this game in a reasonable amount of time, for free. **There are not that many cards**, since this is not a typical CCG.

**There are no P2W or F2P decks in Magic Awakened.** That said, **fully upgrading cards is difficult.** This fact makes a **few decks more F2P-friendly** than others ‚Äî for a variety of reasons that will be covered in this section.

This is not a guide about specific decks, so it will **not enter into great detail** about any of them. This is just general advice for **F2P Players to choose suitable Meta Decks.**

The **meta is ever changing**, and varies by PVP rank, but over time you'll learn **what are the Meta Decks.**

## Dobby Avada: The Whale Hunter

Want to navigate the whale-infested waters of Top Rank Dueling? A Dobby Avada Deck is your best choice. The mighty whale may be bigger, stronger, and healthier than you, but a whale is only mortal, and all mortals fall before Lord Vol‚Äî hem, hem ‚ÄîDobby! **This is the best deck to use against higher level opponents (üê≥).**

Do not mistake this for an overpowered deck. **A Dobby Avada Deck comes with important caveats**:

1. This is not a beginner-friendly deck
2. This is not good in Duo Duels (2V2)
3. This deck struggles against some Meta Decks

**Avada Kavadra** allows you to **ignore the extra HP** your opponent has over you and **Dobby's Echo Ability** is used to avoid their **superior damage output.** Dobby's teleport will put you in the **best position** to hit them with the unforgivable curse.

Those are the **basics** of how the Dobby Avada Deck functions.

## Spell Vs Summon Vs Mixed Decks

So you tried Dobby Avada and hated it? Don't worry, **you still have options.** Worse options, true, but still good options.

**Summon Decks are very beginner-friendly.** Summon Decks feel amazing early on because duelists still have weak basic attacks and are easily overwhelmed by **summon mobs.**

Summons have one big advantage over spells: they are **easy** to use for both attack and defense. That said, compared to spells, **most summons cause less damage per point of mana spent.**

Summon Decks can still be very powerful at the highest ranks, but your chances to win are very level-dependent. **F2P Players should not focus on Summon Decks**, at least not in the long term.

**Spell Decks are the most popular among veterans.** Spells can be very powerful and versatile, especially when taking Echo effects into consideration. It will be harder to win early on with Spell Decks, but the experience will make you **stronger in the long term.**

Spells have two big **disadvantages**: it's easy to waste a spell, and it's hard to balance between attack and defense. The more you know about the game, the easier it will be to use spells correctly. **Spell Decks are the best for F2P Players.**

**Mixed Decks can be just as powerful as Spell Decks.** Such decks are based on Echos that benefit from mixing spell cards with specific summon cards. It's great for players who like summon cards but worry that pure Summon Decks are not powerful enough.

The biggest problem of Summon Decks for F2P Players is that summon cards **do not scale well with upgrades.** Adopting a Mixed Deck might help with that problem. You can focus on upgrading only **very specific summon cards** to build an effective deck.

**F2P Players should play Mixed Decks if they like them more than Spell Decks.** There are no P2W Decks, so you can play anything you like. But upgrades are costly, so you should find a **Meta Deck with a greater focus on spell cards.**
