# 3. You Shall Not Whine About P2W

It is silly to claim there is no Pay to Win in Magic Awakened. **P2W** may be **too expensive** even for most whales, **but it is possible.**

**Try not to whine about P2W.** Not because you lack good reasons for doing so, but because it prevents you from **focusing on what matters.**

Whales can pay to complete the **Battle Pass** without playing. Whales can pay to get extra **Card Duplicates.** Whales can pay to get **P2Wands** every month. Whales can pay for **every resource** in the game. **But why?**

Pay to Win allows players to **quickly reach a level where PVP is no longer fun (the Matchmaking Wall).** Magic Awakened is a game, **it's supposed to be fun.** Frustration reduces playtime, and playing less costs potential resources.

A whale has clear advantages over F2P Players, but **F2P Veterans can compete.**

Please understand, **most whales just want to look fabulous.** Whales do not crave the the power of Dumbledore, only his dress robes. But it's a package deal, so why not show off that fancy new outfit while **stepping on our lifeless corpses** at the Dueling Hall?

The **Paid Battle Pass** offers **new cosmetics** and a few **power-enhancing goodies** to sweeten the deal. It only lasts one month, and it's a nice way to support the game without facing bankruptcy or signing up to a second mortgage.

The **Gacha Wheel** and **paid currency deals**, on the other hand, are reserved for those who love gambling, debt, and **financial despair.** Premium cosmetics, resource packs, and powerful items can only be (realistically) acquired using the **paid currency.**

Whales can **buy any resource** using the paid currency. **The Elder Wand is no match for a credit card.** Almost everything in the game can be bought with enough money.

Whales eat dragons for breakfast. Whales are the most powerful, **and best dressed**, of all magical creatures üê≥

## The P2W Code üê≥

Players who like PVP but have no time or patience to grind for resources may try to **Pay to Win.** That is **expensive**, but **possible** ‚Äî this is the Dark Side.

A player with a Level 9 Deck (11 cards) needs **22000 Gold Coins** to catch up to a player with a Level 10 Deck. That would not be terribly expensive, but it gets **more expensive at Veteran Levels.**

Example: a total of **445,500 Gold Coins are needed to go from Level 10 to Level 15.**

Gold alone could cost hundreds of dollars, but finding enough **Card Duplicates** would **cost much more.** It's impossible to know how much because **luck is involved.**

Only **obscene amounts of money** allow whales to **P2W.** Likely **many thousands of dollars** are needed to **buy** a **Level 100** Magic Book with several **Level 15** Cards in it.

What makes Magic Awakened F2P Friendly is how much **P2W Unfriendly** it is.

Most whales chase **cosmetics,** not P2W resources. Some whales, however, play by a dark code: **The P2W Code.**

## Whales Vs Veterans

The whale slander has come far enough, time to come clean: **veterans are the true whales.** Resources lead to power, and **F2P Veterans** have accumulated more resources than **most whales** could ever afford.

The game rewards **consistent time investment.** Whales blaze through the game **much faster than F2P Players**, and thus tend to play less. Few whales would be able to **compensate lack of playtime with money.**

Buying resources is simply too expensive. **Some money would help**, but **not at Veteran levels.** Only a **small fortune** would be enough.

**Catching up** to players with a high Magic Book Level (veterans) will be **almost as difficult for most whales** as it will be for you. Nobody escapes the grind.
