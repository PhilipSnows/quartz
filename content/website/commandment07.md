# 7. You Shall Hoard Like a Dragon 

![600](https://i.imgur.com/Uog6df6.jpg)

**There are many resources.** It can be confusing, but it's easy once you understand the **true cost of power** in Magic Awakened. Resources lead to power. Always.

Invoke your inner Smaug and hoard. **Hoarding resources is the key to success** (most of the time). The true cost of most good things is **hidden from you** at the start.

**Cheap** things are **rarely worth** the price. Fall for temptation, and the game will slowly deplete your hoard. **When you need** resources for something expensive, it's too late: **you're poor.**

Most of the time it's best to hoard resources for **something expensive.** This guide gives you advice about **how to spend** your main resources.

Remember the Dragon's Rule: **when in doubt, hoard it.**

## Gold

You will not have enough Gold to **fully upgrade Cards and Echos.** This is the most common resource in Magic Awakened, and you have a **Daily Cap of 1200 Gold Coins.**

The Gold cap seems like enough at first, but upgrades have an **exponential cost.** The **true cost of upgrades** is hidden from you.

This does not mean F2P Players need to spend as little Gold as Our King, but it does mean **you should not spend like a Malfoy on a shopping spree**. 

A Common Daily Offer of low-cost useful things can add up to 1134 Gold Coins **(94.5% of your Daily Cap)**. This could still be worth it, but it is not a no-brainer.

Take a similar offer every day, and you will **not be able to hoard Gold** for when things start to get expensive.

It takes **47000 Gold Coins to upgrade one card to Level 15.** If you hit your **Daily Cap of Gold every day** (no easy task) and resist the temptation to spend any of it (unlikely), it would still take **40 DAYS** to upgrade one card. One. Card. There are 11 cards in a deck. And you'd still need all the necessary **Card Duplicates.**

It's best to understand the **true value of a Gold Coin** as soon as possible. Gold scarcity pushes many players to **abandon** the game, or **embrace the dark side (üê≥).** 

Now the good news: you do have **sources of Gold outside of your Daily Cap**, and there are a lot of fun things to do in Magic Awakened besides hoarding.

Just remember to save **most** of your Gold for **card upgrades** and **plenty** of Gold for **Echo upgrades.**

## Gems

![600](https://i.imgur.com/0FC81QQ.jpg)

The amount of ways you can **waste your Gems** is frankly absurd. This is the premium F2P Currency. The paid currency, **Starstone**, has a **1 to 1 trade value with Gems.**

You will often **wonder** if something is worth the asking Gem price, and **that is by design.** Gem offers are **whale traps** meant to entice players to spend **real money** in the game. Gems are **extremely valuable for F2P Players.**

You can put Gem expenses in **three buckets,** each demanding **different considerations.**

![600](https://i.imgur.com/laVwysX.jpg)

### Random Card Packs
* Daily Pack Offers
* Chest/ Charms Research
* Library

**Card Duplicates** are the **most important resource**, but that **does not** mean you should simply spend all your Gems on **Card Packs.**

**Big events** will offer **better Card Pack Offers** with improved **Legendary** odds. **Hoard** most of your Gems for **special offers** instead of **regular offers.**

### Lucky Offers
* Duplicate Packs
* Trade Coin Offers
* Top Potions and Ingredients

You need **experience** to know when an offer is **worth the price.** Duplicate Packs for cards in your main **Meta Deck** are usually worth the asking price.

**Trade Coins** are **just as good** as Duplicate Packs, but the **asking price** may be too high. **Top Potions** are usually **too expensive**, but not always.

### Whale Bait
* 60 Clockturn Keys
* Cosmetics and Wands
* Basic Resources: Echo Crystals, Gold, Echos, Most Potions, etc.

**Everything** is whale bait, but some things more than others. F2P Players benefit from whale bait from time to time, but should **spend as little as possible** on it.

The quintessential baits are **Clockturn Keys, wands, and cosmetics.** F2P Players **should** spin the **Gacha Wheel** at least **once**, but not much more than that.

Some **basic resources** are tempting, but using Gems to acquire them is **usually a bad idea** even with low prices. Your Gems will **slowly deplete** if you do that.

## Clockturn Keys

![600](https://i.imgur.com/SHp6HM8.png)

**Sixty** is the magic number (right, WarnerBros?). You can find Clockturn Keys in PVE or buy each for **200 Gems** (right, WarnerBros?).

This is the resource whales value the most, this is the resource used in the **Gacha Wheel.** Some whales spend **hundreds of dollars** to have 60 Clockturn Keys **every month** and spin that wheel. Don't use a single key without having **enough Gems for 60** of them.

Clockturn Keys are very valuable resources. As a F2P Player, Clockturn Keys are even more valuable, because **collecting 60 of them will not be easy.**

Be very, very, very, very, very, very careful not to spin the wheel unless you are **absolutely sure** you need an item from it. **Items change every month.**

## Echo Crystals

![600](https://i.imgur.com/Xk5cE9D.png)

Echo Crystals are similar to Gold. It's not a premium currency, but **you need a great amount of it.** Legendary Echos are **more expensive** than low grade Echos, but they are **more powerful.**

The longer you can resist spending Echo Crystals, the better. Ideally, you'd only use Echo Crystals to upgrade **Good Legendary Echos.**

The game will **tempt you to upgrade bad Echos** early on, wasting Gold and Echo Crystals. This could **tempt you to use Gems** to acquire more Gold, and **Starstones to Acquire Gems.**

You get the idea. Echos Crystals are used to **tempt you to the dark side (üê≥).** Be smart, do not waste them.

**Do not use Gems** to upgrade Echos, but **do use bad Echos** when you lack enough Echo Crystals.

## Event Currency

![](https://i.imgur.com/LIDjFRZ.png)

There are many events in the game, especially during festivities like **Halloween** and **Christmas.** During an event, **event currency** is used as reward.

The most important thing to remember about event currency is to **spend it before the event is over.** Once the event is over that currency is **useless or swapped** for common resources.

You need to **hoard** the event currency to afford the **best rewards.** It's **better** to spend event currency **near the end** of an event, so you can buy the **best rewards you can afford.**

Once an event is about to end, **spend it all even if you failed** to gather enough.

## Potions & Ingredients

![](https://i.imgur.com/w745bA6.png)

Potions are **not necessary**, but can be **useful.** There are many potions in the game, and gathering **ingredients** to brew them will demand a lot of **grind.**

Some potions are good but **too hard to brew.** Potions are more useful when they can be **used often.** You can benefit from **hoarding** potions for opportune moments.

Different players value different things, so the best potions are a **matter of opinion.** Some players **don't brew potions at all.**

This guide values **resources** above most things, so the **six best potions** listed here are **ranked** based on that criterion.

### 1. Wit-sharpening Potion

![](https://i.imgur.com/XweT0a9.png)

This is arguably the **best potion in the game.** Climb to a high enough rank and most players start to use strong **Meta Decks** with at least a couple of **Legendary Cards** in it. 

You have a **9% chance** of copying any card in your opponents' deck, including their Legendary Cards. These are the **best Legendary odds in the game.**

One Legendary Card? **9%** chance of copy. Two? **18%.** Three? **27%.**

### 2. Draught of Perception

![](https://i.imgur.com/9BdJCZt.png)

The usefulness of this potion is self evident. The fact it **benefits an entire team** is a great advantage. Players with a **regular team** will **greatly benefit** from this potion.

### 3. Wiggenweld Potion

![](https://i.imgur.com/lGxqSmW.png)

Harder quests grant the best rewards. This potion makes **grind more efficient** and benefits an entire **team.** Teams can **take turns** using this potion to increase benefits and **split ingredient costs.**

### 4. Memory Potion

![](https://i.imgur.com/nrETdcZ.png)

This potion comes in **three sizes,** and the effect varies accordingly. Echo and Echo Crystals are very valuable, making this potion particularly useful **when Legendary Echos are more abundant.**

### 5. Strengthening Solution

![](https://i.imgur.com/qzVNma6.png)

This potion is similar to the Wiggenweld Potion, and makes **grind more efficient.** Only **high level players** will greatly **benefit** from this potion, but it's a great **source of extra resources.**

### 6. Draught of Peace

![](https://i.imgur.com/20jLrfa.png)

This is the **most powerful potion** in the game, **many players only brew this.** Do yourself a favor: **don't use it** (most of the time).

You want the Dueling Hall **rewards**, but it's better to get them by **gaining power** instead of using **this crutch.**

The more you rely on this, the greater the **power gap** between you and your adversaries become. This potion will accelerate your journey towards the **Matchmaking Wall.**

That said, the **Draught of Peace** can be very useful when **Dueling Season is about to end.** You can use this potion to get **PVP Season Rewards in time.**

## Thank You Letters

![600](https://i.imgur.com/MU0PbJp.jpg)

F2P Players and whales, friends at last! Players gain 'Thank You Letters' by helping others in **co-op Forbidden Forest (PVE).** This allows weak players to face **difficult PVE scenarios**, and strong players to collect this valuable resource. It's **win-win.**

Collecting letters demands a lot of **grind**, but it's **worth it.** Over time, F2P Players can benefit a lot from this. Team **Trade Tokens** and **Card Packs** are very decent rewards. Although some rewards **may be overpriced** (50 letters for 1 Trade Token is a lot).

Some **potions** and other items may be offered over time, and their **value will vary.** Some events may use 'Thank You Letters' too, so **hoarding** them might be a good idea.

You can never have too many 'Thank You Letters.' **The more, the merrier.**

![600](https://i.imgur.com/RFcyQqg.png)

## Trade Coins, Wild Cards & Duplicate Packs

![](https://i.imgur.com/cSHPsi1.png)

Trade Coins allow you to **trade** cards of specific rarity and Wild Cards function as **Card Duplicates** for **any card** of that rarity. **Duplicate Packs** are occasional offers of **specific** cards.

You have some **limits on Trade Coin amounts**, meaning you **have to use them** as soon as you can **to find more.**

You need a lot of **Card Duplicates** to acquire **Level 15 Cards.** For the most part, you have no control over which Card Duplicates you get, which is why Coins, Wild Cards, and Duplicate Packs are so useful. **They allow you to choose.**

Once you choose a Meta Deck you like, you will have a **list of priority cards to upgrade.** These are the cards you use almost **any amount of resources** to upgrade.

Trade Coins and Wild Cards **don't need to be hoarded**, but they should be **used well.** Use them on your preferred Meta Deck as soon as you can.

## Star $tones üê≥
>"The surfaces had all been draped in lacy covers and paid outfits. There were several vases full of dried flowers, each one residing on its own doily, and on one of the walls was a collection of ornamental plates, each decorated with a large technicolor Gacha kitten wearing a different bow around its neck. These were so foul that the player stared at them, transfixed, until the whale entered the dueling hall holding a P2Wand."
>‚Äî How it feels like too find a whale in PVP

You can buy Starstones with real money. My advice if you decide to buy those pink abominations is to spend it all on fabulous cosmetics and never, ever, play dueling matches against me. Lord Voldemort put a terrible curse on such duelists. You have been warned.
