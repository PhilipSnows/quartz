# 5. You Shall Not Gamble... Often

Harry Potter Magic Awakened is a **difficult game to label.** You can say it's a Collectable Card Game (CCG), an Action-adventure Role Playing Game, a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA), or you can say it's a **Gacha Game.**

Magic Awakened has **elements of many types of games.** Players don't pull the wheel to collect new characters like in Gacha games, but **every month there are a couple of Gacha items** that do entice players to gamble.

Gacha cosmetic items are **time-limited** to entice Fear of Missing Out (**FOMO**). F2P Players can, **and should**, ignore this aspect of the game, except for one thing: A powerful **P2Wand.**

P2Wands are the only Gacha items in the game that grant significant gameplay advantages. Thankfully, there is a way to **win Gacha prizes for free.**

## P2Wands

Oh, look, it sparkles! And it has a 15% Exploration Attribute?! SCORE! 

Let's just say Magic Awakened players are not the most loyal witches and wizards out there, even the Hupplepuffs. That **first wand** you acquire at Olivander's will be **gathering dust** at the bottom of your school trunk faster than you can say *Draco dormiens nunquam titillandus*.

There are a lot of wands in the game and most are money traps. Whales like to collect fancy wands but F2P Players should mostly focus on their attributes:

* **Dueling Club Rescue Attempts:** The quintessential P2W element of Magic Awakened that gives you a big advantage in 2V2 PVP.
* **Exploration Attributes:** Increases stats in PVE. The real P2W element of P2Wands, because it helps with the PVE grind for resources.
* **MP Regen Speed:** Gives you an edge in challenging PVE scenarios. One may argue this is better than the bonus to Exploration Attributes.
* **Collection Points:** The attribute of cosmetic items that allows you to upgrade your room to flex how many cosmetics you have. Mostly useless for F2P Players.
* **Magic Proficiency Gained:** Allows you to gain cosmetics for your spells at a faster rate. 100% useless.

Most P2Wands are locked behind **pay walls** (usually the Gacha Wheel) and demand a lot of resources to acquire. But **F2P Players can still get them.**

What you really want is a wand with a **15% Exploration Attribute** bonus and an extra **Dueling Club Rescue Attempt.**

Do not settle for anything less. **Save** resources like Gems and Clockturn Keys **until such a P2Wand is available on the Gacha Wheel.** Most wands F2P Players acquire should be free PVP or PVE rewards.

Wands are expensive. **Do not waste resources on crappy wands.**

## The Gacha Wheel üê≥
>"Turns out he's in big trouble with the goblins. Borrowed loads of gold off them. A gang of them cornered him in the woods after the World Cup and took all the gold he had, and it still wasn't enough to cover all his debts. They followed him all the way to Hogwarts to keep an eye on him. He‚Äôs lost everything gambling."
>‚ÄîGambling is bad, kids

Don't worry, **we have a system.** Ok, maybe worry a little bit. You can ignore most Gacha in Magic Awakened, but sooner or later **F2P Players** will be **tempted** by an item on the wheel.

A F2P Player is advised to **touch the wheel for one thing**, and one thing only: **Power.** Something like a **P2Wand** with **15% Exploration Attributes** and 1 extra **Dueling Club Rescue Attempt.**

The wheel has a **pity system of 60 pulls (RIGHT, WARNERBROS?!).** Save enough resources for 60 pulls, and it's barely gambling ‚Äî **you will get the item you want.** If you're lucky and get the item soon, you would not have to save a lot for a future wheel.

That was the good news, now the bad news: you need to save Gems to get those 60 pulls. Around **two months worth of free Gems** to buy **60 Clockturn Keys.** Worse news: The items on the **wheel change every month.** If you want it, but don't have enough Clockturn Keys for 60 pulls, you'd be tempted to transfigure into a **whale** üê≥

You either have enough for 60 pulls, or you move on. There will be similar items in future wheels. **Patience is key (pun intended).** Now the worst news: **This is (like) gambling.** Gambling is regulated for a good reason.

You need to **be cold about this aspect of Magic Awakened.** Never bet on luck. Do not touch the wheel without enough resources for 60 pulls. Be advised that whales consider between **40 and 50 pulls for an item to be average.**

Some people have spent well over $10,000 on this game chasing **time-limited** cosmetics. **There is a pity system, not a generosity system.** The odds are stacked against you. Be careful.
