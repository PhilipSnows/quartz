# 10. You Shall Not Pass üßôüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Yes, this commandment is just a nerdy **joke.** Made for **fun.**

**Burnout** will destroy you. A game needs to be fun, so if it's not fun anymore, **take a break.**

The one advantage F2P Players have over whales is **reduced FOMO.** A limited-time cosmetic **means nothing** to you.

Yes, you will fall further behind by playing less, but **F2P Players are always behind anyway.** You play the long game.

This game is amazing, but **PVE** content will **run out** and **PVP will get frustrating.** The **Matchmaking Wall** is inevitable.

Come back when **new PVE content is added**, new **Dueling Season** begins. Maybe help improve this guide for F2P Players ( *wink, wink* ).

**Don't bang your head against the wall.**

## The Whale & the F2P Player

A Whale was making fun of the F2P Player one day for being so weak.

"Will you ever reach Hall of Fame?" she asked with a mocking laugh.

"Yes," replied the F2P Player, "and I get there sooner than you think. I'll run you a race and prove it."

The Whale was much amused at the idea of running a race with the F2P Player, but for the fun of the thing she agreed. So Warner Bros Games who had consented to act as judge, launched a new Dueling Season and started the duelers off.

The Whale soon reached a score of 7400 points at the Dueling Club, and to make the F2P Player feel very deeply how ridiculous it was for him to try a race with a Whale, she took a break from the game until the F2P Player should catch up.

The F2P Player meanwhile kept getting stronger slowly but steadily, and, after a time, passed the rank of the Whale at the Dueling Club. But the Whale was still on a break; and when at last she decided to play again, the F2P Player was very near the Hall of Fame. The Whale then spent an extra $500 on the game, and reached Hall of Fame before the F2P Player anyway.

Moral of the story: The whale usually wins.

**The End.**
