# 1. You Shall Invest in Power

Harry Potter Magic Awakened **can be complicated.** There is a lot to learn as you play. Many resources, ways to spend resources, and activities in the game. 

One trick to **make things easier** when you don't understand something is to ask: **how will that increase my power?** This is most useful when in doubt about resources.

There are **three interconnected systems of power** in the game: Magic Book, Card Upgrade, and Echo.

The better you **understand those systems**, the easier it gets.

## Magic Book System

Health, Attack, Luck, Exploration Attributes ‚Äî this is power in Harry Potter: Magic Awakened. **Upgrading cards makes them more powerful** and grants experience, and experience increases your **Magic Book Level**, making **you more powerful**.

* **Health:** Your maximum amount of Health Points (HP). This is affected by your Magic Book and Echo Bonus.
* **Attack:** Indicates your basic attack power. This is affected by your Magic Book and Echo Bonus.
* **Luck:** Increases your odds of finding Legendary Cards. This is affected by unique items in the game.
* **Exploration Attributes:** Increases your stats in PVE, helping you gather resources. This is affected by your Magic Book Bonus and certain items in the game.

To upgrade your cards you need resources. **Whales** and **veterans** are powerful because they had access to more resources than you. They invested more on card upgrades, so they have a greater **Total Amount of Experience.**

It's not only the two things used to upgrade cards that matter ([[Commandment 07#Gold|Gold]] and [[Commandment 07#Trade Coins, Wild Cards & Duplicate Packs|Card Duplicates]]). **Almost every resource can help increase your Magic Book Level**, directly or indirectly. 

Resources can be used for a variety of things, in a variety of ways. **A whale may end up with a low Magic Book Level because of how they spent their resources.** The key to survive as a F2P Player is resource management. Always. Resources lead to power.

## Card Upgrade System

Regardless of how you use resources, upgrades boil down to **Gold** and **Card Duplicates.** You need a lot of Gold Coins. You need a lot of Card Duplicates.

Magic Awakened is not a typical Collectable Card Game (CCG). A game like Yu-Gi-Oh has thousands of cards, this one has less than 100. Even **F2P Players can collect all cards in a few weeks.** Finding Card Duplicates is the real challenge.

Every time you find new cards there is (usually) **less than 1% chance** of finding the **exact card** you want. The more common a card is, the more Card Duplicates of that **exact card** you will need.

And even so: It is (arguably) **more difficult to find 32 Legendary Card Duplicates than 1177 Common Card Duplicates.**

Magic Awakened players will lust over **Legendary Card Duplicates** about as often as Bellatrix lusts over Voldemort.

## Echo System

An Echo is the **heart of a deck.** Each Echo has a **special ability** based on a character from the Harry Potter universe, and grants a **bonus to HP**, **attack**, and **specific cards** in a deck. 

What makes a card good or bad is [[Commandment 08|how much it suits the Echo]] used in a deck.

Question: **How many resources** would you need to acquire **Good Max Level Legendary Echos?** Answer: **Yes.**

The game will happily encourage you to throw everything **and the kitchen sink** at this black hole. [[Commandment 07#Echo Crystals|Echo Crystals]]? Obviously. [[Commandment 07#Gold|Gold]]? Sure. [[Commandment 07#Gems|Gems]]? Definitely possible. Other Echos? Go nuts.

Besides your Magic Book and Card Level, nothing grants **as much power as your Echo.** Finding a Legendary Echo is not that hard. Finding a **Good** Legendary Echo is hard.

Upgrading a Legendary Echo to its **maximum level** will demand a **ton of resources.** Finding out that most cards your Echo buffs are useless to you ‚Äî after you invested the necessary resources ‚Äî is **priceless.**

**This is what you need to do**: 

1. Find a Legendary Echo that buffs the cards you want buffed;
2. Upgrade it to reveal other cards it buffs (optional: rage about it);
3. Invest more resources to change/improve buffs.

Dragons, mermaids, and kind Slytherins are real, but **perfect Echos are a myth.** 

You should invest in **Good Max Level Legendary Echos**, but upgrading many versions of the same Echo chasing a **Perfect Echo** is not wise. 

It's better to have a **variety of good Echos** instead of a single perfect Echo.
