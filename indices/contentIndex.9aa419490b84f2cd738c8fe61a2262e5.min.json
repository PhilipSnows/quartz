Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](notes/troubleshooting.md).\n\n## Language Support\n[CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(ÊµãËØï).md) comes out of the box with Quartz.\n\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)? Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'ŸÖÿØŸàŸÜÿ™Ÿä'\n    weight = 1\n```\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-24T13:49:55.76171988Z","tags":["setup"]},"/notes/custom-Domain":{"title":"Custom Domain","content":"\n### Registrar\nThis step is only applicable if you are using a **custom domain**!

You should set the environment variable `HUGO_BASEURL=http://your-public-ip` and then start your container.\n2. Set up port forwarding on your router from port `p` to `your-local-ip:1313`.\n3. You should now be able to access Quartz from outside your local network at `http://your-public-ip:p`.\n\nHowever, your HTTP connection will be unencrypted and **this method is not secure**.\n\n### To a Domain using Cloudflare Proxy\n\n1. Port forward 443 (HTTPS) from your machine.\n2. Buy a custom domain (say, `your-domain.com`) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/). Point a DNS A record from `your-domain.com` to your public IP address and enable the proxy.\n3. Set the environment variables `HUGO_BASEURL=https://your-domain.com`, `HUGO_PORT=443`, and `HUGO_APPENDPORT=false`. Change `1313:1313` to `443:443` for the `ports` in `docker-compose.yml`.\n4. Spin up your Quartz container and enjoy it at `https://your-domain.com`!\n\n### To a Domain using a Reverse Proxy\n\nIf you want to serve more than just Quartz to the internet on this machine (or don't want to use the Cloudflare registrar and proxy), you should follow the steps in the section above (as appropriate) and also set up a reverse proxy, like [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik).

You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files. Make sure that your title is double-quoted and that you have a title defined at the top of your file like so, otherwise the generated page will not have a title!\n\nYou can also add tags here as well.\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Example Title\"\ntags:\n- example-tag\n---\n\nRest of your content here...\n```\n\n### Obsidian\nI recommend using [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) as a way to edit and grow your digital garden.

Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub.

Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

There are an overwhelming number of tutorials, resources, and guides for tools like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), yet none of them have super easy to use *free* tools to publish that garden to the world.\n\nI've personally found that\n1. It's nice to access notes from anywhere\n2. Having a public digital garden invites open conversations\n3. It makes keeping personal notes and knowledge *playful and fun*\n\nI was really inspired by [Bianca](https://garden.bianca.digital/) and [Joel](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)'s digital gardens and wanted to try making my own.\n\n**The goal of Quartz is to make hosting your own public digital garden free and simple.** You don't even need your own website. Quartz does all of that for you and gives your own little corner of the internet.\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-24T13:49:55.765719934Z","tags":[]},"/notes/preview-changes":{"title":"Preview Changes","content":"\nIf you'd like to preview what your Quartz site looks like before deploying it to the internet, the following\ninstructions guide you through installing the proper dependencies to run it locally.\n\n\n## Install `hugo-obsidian`\nThis step will generate the list of backlinks for Hugo to parse. Ensure you have [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (\u003e= 1.16) installed.\n\n```bash\n# Install and link `hugo-obsidian` locally\ngo install github.com/jackyzha0/hugo-obsidian@latest\n```\n\nIf you are running into an error saying that `command not found: hugo-obsidian`, make sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly (see [[notes/troubleshooting#`command not found: hugo-obsidian`|the troubleshooting page]])! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize hugo-obsidian as an executable.\n\n##  Installing Hugo\nHugo is the static site generator that powers Quartz. [Install Hugo with \"extended\" Sass/SCSS version](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) first. Then,\n\n```bash\n# Navigate to your local Quartz folder\ncd \u003clocation-of-your-local-quartz\u003e\n\n# Start local server\nmake serve\n\n# View your site in a browser at http://localhost:1313/\n```\n\n\u003e [!INFO] Docker Support\n\u003e\n\u003e If you have the Docker CLI installed already, you can avoid installing `hugo-obsidian` and `hugo`. Instead, open your terminal, navigate to your folder with Quartz and run `make docker`\n\nAfterwards, start the Hugo server as shown above and your local backlinks and interactive graph should be populated! Now, let's get it hosted online.\n\n\u003e üåç Step 5: [Hosting Quartz online!](notes/hosting.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-24T13:49:55.765719934Z","tags":["setup"]},"/notes/search":{"title":"Search","content":"\nQuartz supports two modes of searching through content.\n\n## Full-text\nFull-text search is the default in Quartz. It produces results that *exactly* match the search query. This is easier to setup but usually produces lower quality matches.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: false\n```\n\n## Natural Language\nNatural language search is powered by [Operand](https://beta.operand.ai/). It understands language like a person does and finds results that best match user intent. In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.\n\nNatural language search tends to produce higher quality results than full-text search.\n\nHere's how to set it up.\n\n1. Login or Register for a new Operand account. Click the verification link sent to your email, and you'll be redirected to the dashboard. (Note) You do not need to enter a credit card to create an account, or get started with the Operand API. The first $10 of usage each month is free. To learn more, see pricing. If you go over your free quota, we'll (politely) reach out and ask you to configure billing.\n2. Create your first index. On the dashboard, under \"Indexes\", enter the name and description of your index, and click \"Create Index\". Note down the ID of the index (obtained by clicking on the index name in the list of indexes), as you'll need it in the next step. IDs are unique to each index, and look something like `uqv1duxxbdxu`.\n3. Click into the index you've created. Under \"Index Something\", select \"SITEMAP\" from the dropdown and click \"Add Source\".\n4. For the \"Sitemap.xml URL\", put your deployed site's base URL followed by `sitemap.xml`. For example, for `quartz.jzhao.xyz`, put `https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/sitemap.xml`. Leave the URL Regex empty. \n5. Get your API key. On the dashboard, under \"API Keys\", you can manage your API keys. If you don't already have an API key, click \"Create API Key\". You'll need this for the next step.\n6. Open `data/config.yaml`. Set `enableSemanticSearch` to `true`, `operandApiKey` to your copied key, and `operandIndexId` to the ID of the index we created from earlier..\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nsearch:\n  enableSemanticSearch: true\n  operandApiKey: \"jp9k5hudse2a828z98kxd6z3payi8u90rnjf\"\n  operandIndexId: \"s0kf3bd6tldw\"\n```\n7. Push your changes to the site and wait for it to deploy.\n8. Check the Operand dashboard and wait for your site to index.

If you are unfamiliar, [this resource](https://resources.nwplus.io/2-beginner/how-to-git-github.html) is a great place to start!\n\n### Forking\n\u003e A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.\n\nNavigate to the GitHub repository for the Quartz project:\n\nüìÅ [Quartz Repository](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)\n\nThen, Fork the repository into your own GitHub account. **Make sure that when you fork, you _uncheck_ the 'Copy the `hugo` branch only' option**.\n\nIf you don't have an account, you can make on for free [here](https://github.com/join). More details about forking a repo can be found on [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).\n\n![[notes/images/fork.png]]\n\n### Cloning\nAfter you've made a fork of the repository, you need to download the files locally onto your machine. Ensure you have `git`, then type the following command in your terminal replacing `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username.\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/quartz\n```\n\n## Editing\nGreat!

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(ÊµãËØï).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile # again, (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup analytics?\nQuartz by default uses [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) for analytics. \n\nIf you would prefer to use Google Analytics, you can follow this [guide in the Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/templates/internal/#google-analytics). \n\nAlternatively, you can also import your Google Analytics data into Plausible by [following this guide](https://plausible.io/docs/google-analytics-import).\n\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\nüêõ [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-24T13:49:55.765719934Z","tags":[]},"/notes/updating":{"title":"Updating","content":"\nHaven't updated Quartz in a while and want all the cool new optimizations?

With some preparation, **F2P Players can win PVP against whales** and **veterans.**\n\nThis is a compendium of tips, advice, memes, and bad jokes. There may be some **general tips** in the guide, but the **focus is on PVP**, and the main target audience are **Free to Play (F2P) Players.**\n\nMost advice here is based on experience with the **Taiwan (TW) Version** of 'Harry Potter: Magic Awakened'. Some content may not apply to the (more Pay to Win) **Global Version.**\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/W3UBqdk.png)\n\n## How To Use This Guide\nThe guide is divided in 10 commandments (sections). Each section starts with a **summary of that commandment**, also know as \"Too Long, Didn't Read (TLDR).\"\n\nThere is no need to read the entire guide back to back. **Just do the following:**\n\n1. Go to a main section;\n2. Skip quotes and memes if you hate fun;\n3. Read the summary;\n4. Read sub-sections if it interests you;\n5. Move on to a different section if it does not interest you;\n\n## The 10 Commandments\nThe secret to survive as a F2P Player will be repeated a lot in this guide: **resource management.** Always.\n\n**The 10 Commandments** just detail **how** and **why.** Commandments are:\n\n1. You Shall Invest in Power\n2. You Shall Become a Veteran\n3. You Shall Not Whine About P2W\n4. You Shall Whine About Matchmaking\n5. You Shall Not Gamble... Often\n6. You Shall Not Crave Thy Neighbor's Cosmetics\n7. You Shall Hoard Like a Dragon\n8. You Shall Use Meta Decks\n9. You Shall Upgrade Strategically\n10. You Shall Not Pass üßôüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\n# 1. You Shall Invest in Power\n\u003e‚ÄúIt is a curious thing, Harry, but perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it, they just buy it with a credit card.\"\n\u003e‚Äî Dumbledore talking nonsense\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/YO2BTgN.jpg)\n\nHarry Potter Magic Awakened **can be complicated.** There is a lot to learn as you play. Many resources, ways to spend resources, and activities in the game. \n\nOne trick to **make things easier** when you don't understand something is to ask: **how will that increase my power?** This is most useful when in doubt about resources.\n\nThere are **three interconnected systems of power** in the game: Magic Book, Card Upgrade, and Echo.\n\nThe better you **understand those systems**, the easier it gets.\n\n## Magic Book System\n\u003e\"Ron speared a roast potato on the end of his fork, glaring at it. Then he said, 'I hate being poor.'\"\n\u003e‚Äî Ronald Weasley: kindred spirit, beloved king\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/n3ywSrE.png)\n\nHealth, Attack, Luck, Exploration Attributes ‚Äî this is power in Harry Potter: Magic Awakened. **Upgrading cards makes them more powerful** and grants experience, and experience increases your **Magic Book Level**, making **you more powerful**.\n\n* **Health:** Your maximum amount of Health Points (HP). This is affected by your Magic Book and Echo Bonus.\n* **Attack:** Indicates your basic attack power. This is affected by your Magic Book and Echo Bonus.\n* **Luck:** Increases your odds of finding Legendary Cards. This is affected by unique items in the game.\n* **Exploration Attributes:** Increases your stats in PVE, helping you gather resources. This is affected by your Magic Book Bonus and certain items in the game.\n\nTo upgrade your cards you need resources. **Whales** and **veterans** are powerful because they had access to more resources than you. They invested more on card upgrades, so they have a greater **Total Amount of Experience.**\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/DxEOvFQ.png)\n\nIt's not only the two things used to upgrade cards that matter (Gold and Card Duplicates). **Almost every resource can help increase your Magic Book Level**, directly or indirectly. \n\nResources can be used for a variety of things, in a variety of ways. **A whale may end up with a low Magic Book Level because of how they spent their resources.** The key to survive as a F2P Player is resource management. Always. Resources lead to power.\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/T9N7SRL.png)\n\n## Card Upgrade System\n\u003e‚ÄúInsanity is buying cosmetics over and over and expecting to have enough resources to upgrade that one legendary card in your deck.‚Äù\n\u003e‚Äî Enlightened Magic Awakened Player\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/TldArh9.png)\n\nRegardless of how you use resources, upgrades boil down to **Gold** and **Card Duplicates.** You need a lot of Gold Coins. You need a lot of Card Duplicates.\n\nMagic Awakened is not a typical Collectable Card Game (CCG). A game like Yu-Gi-Oh has thousands of cards, this one has less than 100. Even **F2P Players can collect all cards in a few weeks.** Finding Card Duplicates is the real challenge.\n\nEvery time you find new cards there is (usually) **less than 1% chance** of finding the **exact card** you want. The more common a card is, the more Card Duplicates of that **exact card** you will need.\n\nAnd even so: It is (arguably) **more difficult to find 32 Legendary Card Duplicates than 1177 Common Card Duplicates.**\n\nMagic Awakened players will lust over **Legendary Card Duplicates** about as often as Bellatrix lusts over Voldemort.\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/h6RXL9z.jpg)\n\n## Echo System\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/Kti5v25.jpg)\n\nAn Echo is the **heart of a deck.** Each Echo has a **special ability** based on a character from the Harry Potter universe, and grants a **bonus to HP**, **attack**, and **specific cards** in a deck. \n\nWhat makes a card good or bad is **how much it suits the Echo** used in a deck.\n\nQuestion: **How many resources** would you need to acquire **Good Max Level Legendary Echos?** Answer: **Yes.**\n\nThe game will happily encourage you to throw everything **and the kitchen sink** at this black hole. Echo Crystals? Obviously. Gold? Sure. Gems? Definitely possible. Other Echos? Go nuts.\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/URTYItD.png)\n\nBesides your Magic Book and Card Level, nothing grants **as much power as your Echo.** Finding a Legendary Echo is not that hard. Finding a **Good** Legendary Echo is hard.\n\nUpgrading a Legendary Echo to its **maximum level** will demand a **ton of resources.** Finding out that most cards your Echo buffs are useless to you ‚Äî after you invested the necessary resources ‚Äî is **priceless.**\n\n**This is what you need to do**: \n\n1. Find a Legendary Echo that buffs the cards you want buffed;\n2. Upgrade it to reveal other cards it buffs (optional: rage about it);\n3. Invest more resources to change/improve buffs.\n\nDragons, mermaids, and kind Slytherins are real, but **perfect Echos are a myth.** \n\nYou should invest in **Good Max Level Legendary Echos**, but upgrading many versions of the same Echo chasing a **Perfect Echo** is not wise. \n\nIt's better to have a **variety of good Echos** instead of a single perfect Echo.\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/hKKMGvd.png)\n\n# 2. You Shall Become a Veteran\n\u003e Is the game Pay to Win? Is the dark side stronger?\n\u003e ‚Äî Young Padawan asking reasonable questions.\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/lQUzSm2.png)\n\nYou play games to have fun, you grind to win. **Winning is fun**, credit card debt is not.\n\nAs a F2P Player, It is understandable to get frustrated by P2W. A player who invests money in the game has clear advantages, but so does a **player who keeps playing despite everything.**\n\n**Players who keep playing despite PVP frustrations become veterans.** Veterans are more powerful than 99% of whales. \n\nThe difference in power between F2P Players and whales is (usually) small. The only P2W item that grants any amount of power in this game is a **P2Wand**, and F2P Players can **get one by saving resources and biding their time.**\n\nAll players **just want to have fun in PVP**, they only differ in how to pursue that.\n\n## The PVE Grind\n\u003e\"The silver doe burst from the tip of his wand. Not from some lousy stick, not from some 2-Galleon twig, but from the tip of the most magnificent, the most powerful P2Wand the World has ever seen. 'You have been saving,' said Dumbledore in disbelief, 'all this time?'\"\n\u003e‚Äî Harry Potter and the F2P Veteran\n\n![300](https://i.imgur.com/qNUjo9k.jpg)\n\nF2P Players should play **in a smart way.** PVP is more fun, but **PVE grants most resources.** You should get the **most rewards out of your time.**\n\n**Fun is the most important resource of all,** because of daily, weekly, and monthly caps. The longer you play without getting frustrated, taking breaks, or quitting the game, **the more resources you gather in the long run.** \n\n**Do not overplay any activity.** Once you hit a daily or weekly cap, move on to something else. Daily, Weekly, and Monthly Caps are barriers between you and power. You should **play around these barriers, not against them.**\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/eyfRpFc.jpg)\n\nGrind should fit the time you're willing to invest in it. Only a **few minutes?** Do daily tasks. **Half an hour?** Add some story missions or team activities. **The ideal grind order is:**\n\n1. Daily Tasks\n2. Event, Story, or Side Missions\n3. Forbidden Forest\n4. Team Activities\n6. Co-op Forest (for Thank You Letters)\n7. PVP\n\nMonthly goals drive you. You have **the entire month** to reach Hall of Fame, complete the Season Pass, or grind enough resources to afford monthly prizes or the Gacha Wheel. **Pace yourself** to avoid **boredom** and **frustration.**\n\nIt's ok to miss your goals, the most important thing is to **come back to grind** the next day. Keep it **fun**, and **power** will come **over time.**\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/Rp613PV.png)\n\n## The F2P Code \u0026 Veterans\n\u003e\"This is the way.\"\n\u003e‚ÄîFollow the code, Mudblood\n\n![300](https://i.imgur.com/HOVbcoI.png)\n\nYou either die a **casual**, or play long enough to **become a veteran.** F2P Players do not have to sacrifice much to get there (beside cosmetics). Play smart. **Patience, persistence, discipline** ‚Äî these will go a long way as a F2P Player.\n\nMagic Awakened is not a race, it's more like a **Collect-a-Thon** ‚Äî what matters the most is how many resources you collected by the time you reach the finish line.\n\nThat's basically a veteran: **a player who collected many resources and used them well.**\n\nThere is a path to power, and that path can be very fun to traverse. It's not all doom and gloom for F2P Players. Remember that **Harry Potter Magic Awakened is incredible, even without a credit card.** \n\nSo, to become a Veteran, follow the **F2P Code:**\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/vmBQvQo.png)\n\n# 3. You Shall Not Whine About P2W\n\u003eGood... use your aggressive feelings, player. Let the hate flow through you.\n\u003e‚ÄîDarth Voldemort pushing you to the Dark Side\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/P6B2EOO.png)\n\nIt is silly to claim there is no Pay to Win in Magic Awakened. **P2W** may be **too expensive** even for most whales, **but it is possible.**\n\n**Try not to whine about P2W.** Not because you lack good reasons for doing so, but because it prevents you from **focusing on what matters.**\n\nWhales can pay to complete the **Battle Pass** without playing. Whales can pay to get extra **Card Duplicates.** Whales can pay to get **P2Wands** every month. Whales can pay for **every resource** in the game. **But why?**\n\nPay to Win allows players to **quickly reach a level where PVP is no longer fun (the Matchmaking Wall).** Magic Awakened is a game, **it's supposed to be fun.** Frustration reduces playtime, and playing less costs potential resources.\n\nA whale has clear advantages over F2P Players, but **F2P Veterans can compete.**\n\n## The P2W Advantage üê≥\n\u003e\"Aye, aye! It was that accursed white whale that razeed me; made a poor pegging lubber of me for ever and a day!\"\n\u003e‚Äî Captain Ahab, a F2P Player\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/Ga8R2t5.png)\n\nPlease understand, **most whales just want to look fabulous.** Whales do not crave the the power of Dumbledore, only his dress robes. But it's a package deal, so why not show off that fancy new outfit while **stepping on our lifeless corpses** at the Dueling Hall?\n\nThe **Paid Battle Pass** offers **new cosmetics** and a few **power-enhancing goodies** to sweeten the deal. It only lasts one month, and it's a nice way to support the game without facing bankruptcy or signing up to a second mortgage.\n\nThe **Gacha Wheel** and **paid currency deals**, on the other hand, are reserved for those who love gambling, debt, and **financial despair.** Premium cosmetics, resource packs, and powerful items can only be (realistically) acquired using the **paid currency.**\n\nWhales can **buy any resource** using the paid currency. **The Elder Wand is no match for a credit card.** Almost everything in the game can be bought with enough money.\n\nWhales eat dragons for breakfast. Whales are the most powerful, **and best dressed**, of all magical creatures üê≥\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/cjuehNy.png)\n\n## The P2W Code üê≥\n\u003e‚ÄúYou have controlled your fear. Now, open your wallet. Only your savings can destroy me.‚Äù\n\u003e ‚ÄîLord Whale and the teachings of the Dark Side\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/AOqoAM9.png)\n\nPlayers who like PVP but have no time or patience to grind for resources may try to **Pay to Win.** That is **expensive**, but **possible** ‚Äî this is the Dark Side.\n\nA player with a Level 9 Deck (11 cards) needs **22000 Gold Coins** to catch up to a player with a Level 10 Deck. That would not be terribly expensive, but it gets **more expensive at Veteran Levels.**\n\nExample: a total of **445,500 Gold Coins are needed to go from Level 10 to Level 15.**\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/Rd2hpKr.png)\n\nGold alone could cost hundreds of dollars, but finding enough **Card Duplicates** would **cost much more.** It's impossible to know how much because **luck is involved.**\n\nOnly **obscene amounts of money** allow whales to **P2W.** Likely **many thousands of dollars** are needed to **buy** a **Level 100** Magic Book with several **Level 15** Cards in it.\n\nWhat makes Magic Awakened F2P Friendly is how much **P2W Unfriendly** it is.\n\nMost whales chase **cosmetics,** not P2W resources. Some whales, however, play by a dark code: **The P2W Code.**\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/cADbPHL.png)\n\n## Whales Vs Veterans\n\u003e\"There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too poor to seek it.\"\n\u003e‚Äî Lord Whale: He Who Must Not Play Fair\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/9teJzbN.jpg)\n\nThe whale slander has come far enough, time to come clean: **veterans are the true whales.** Resources lead to power, and **F2P Veterans** have accumulated more resources than **most whales** could ever afford.\n\nThe game rewards **consistent time investment.** Whales blaze through the game **much faster than F2P Players**, and thus tend to play less. Few whales would be able to **compensate lack of playtime with money.**\n\nBuying resources is simply too expensive. **Some money would help**, but **not at Veteran levels.** Only a **small fortune** would be enough.\n\n**Catching up** to players with a high Magic Book Level (veterans) will be **almost as difficult for most whales** as it will be for you. Nobody escapes the grind.\n\n# 4. You Shall Whine About Matchmaking\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/kUM8ljj.jpg)\n\nThere are various **types of players** in the game, and some are **always ahead of you.**  Paying for power is not worth it.\n\n**Frustration hits every player** sooner or later, even whales. F2P Players and P2W Players are just **dealing with that frustration in different ways.** \n\nEventually you will encounter opponents you can't defeat with only your **skill... or your wallet.** Paying for power only accelerates your journey towards the **Matchmaking Wall.**\n\nWhen people complain about **whales**, **veterans**, or **P2W**, they are actually complaining about the **Matchmaking System.** Players complain about the Matchmaking System because of the **Matchmaking Wall.**\n\n**The Matchmaking Wall** is very **frustrating**, it **pushes many players away** from PVP (and the game) altogether.\n\n## The Eight Types of Players\n\u003e\"There will be eight Harry Potters moving through the Dueling Halls tonight, each of them in a paid outfit, or a filthy rag, depending on their playstyle.‚Äù\n\u003e‚Äî Harry Potter and the Deathly Whales üê≥\n\nThere are different **types of players** in this game. You have to understand what it means to be a whale in Harry Potter: Magic Awakened. Here is a list of ocean dwellers, **ranked from harmless to scariest:**\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/9Z3lmdP.png)\n\n**F2P Players** do not spend money in the game. At most you bought the Battle Pass once or twice. If players are sea creatures, you are like a krill ‚Äî the creature whales feed upon. There are a ton of us in the game, and nobody cares when a single one dies üíÄ\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/I5iZCV9.png)\n\n**Dolphins** spend a decent amount of money in the game. A dolphin may buy the Battle Pass often, and many cosmetics. Dolphins do have access to more resources than F2P Players, but not by much. Dolphins are like F2P Players with prettier outfits.\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/IXMt03l.png)\n\n**Whales** spend a lot of money in the game. Like a dolphin, whales tend to spend most extra resources on cosmetics. Whales are stronger than F2P Players, but a few days on a break from the game would close that power gap.\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/uGsQobU.png)\n\n**Blue whales** are not like most whales. Most whales do the math and realize it would be insane to pay for a High Magic Book Level. Blue whales follow the P2W Code. Blue whales are like veterans without the skill.\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/73wN4Ny.png)\n\n**F2P or Dolphin Veterans** are the reason why so many people argue the game is not P2W. Time allows you to collect a fortune worth of resources. A veteran is like an Orca ‚Äî not really a whale, but only experts can tell the difference.\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/jYYjeSI.png)\n\n**Veteran Whales** are whales that play as much as veterans. How do you catch up? You don't. The difference in power between veterans and veteran whales is not huge, but it does exist. This only changes once both veterans reach Magic Book Level 100.\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/GMigxxF.png)\n\n**Eldritch Veterans.** Little must be spoken of such creatures ‚Äîleast one incurs their wrath. Beyond Hall of Fame, at the top of Global PVP rankings, you may glimpse at them. To speculate on how they got there is folly. They lurk... on long queue lines.\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/uWkaJjs.png)\n\n**Cthulhu** does not upgrade cards but defeats veterans anyway. Cthulhu is real.\n\nNow you know whales are not all the same. It's all about how players spends their extra resources. For all intents and purposes, **F2P Players can be just as scary.** Whales just dress better.\n\n## The Matchmaking Wall\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/n0w0Iwj.jpg)\n\nPaying for power only delays the Matchmaking Wall. Whales suffer from P2W too, there is **always a bigger wallet in the sea.** Our common gripe is with the **Matchmaking System.**\n\n**PVP is fun** for F2P Players until you reach a rank full of **whales.** PVP is fun for whales until they reach a rank full of **bigger whales.** \n\n**Skilled players** can defeat opponents with a higher Magic Book Level, **up to a point.** Eventually players **can't close the gap with skill alone.** This is the **Matchmaking Wall.**\n\nAgainst the wall, **even victories are not as fun.** The only way to get past the wall is to **upgrade** your Magic Book Level and Deck, but **upgrades take longer each time.**\n\nPlayers need a lot of **money**, a lot of **grind**, or **both**, to get past the Matchmaking Wall. And on the other side of the wall? A **bigger wall** and **longer queue times.**\n\nMagic Awakened is great, but the matchmaking system sucks.\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/FfGH1jt.png)\n\n# 5. You Shall Not Gamble... Often\n\u003e‚ÄúWe‚Äôll bet thirty-seven Galleons, fifteen Gems, three Gold Coins,‚Äù said Fred as he and George quickly pooled all their money,‚Äú that Ireland wins ‚Äî but Viktor Krum gets the Snitch. Oh and we‚Äôll throw in a P2Wand.‚Äù\n\u003e‚Äî Harry Potter and the Magical Bookie\n\nHarry Potter Magic Awakened is a **difficult game to label.** You can say it's a Collectable Card Game (CCG), an Action-adventure Role Playing Game, a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA), or you can say it's a **Gacha Game.**\n\nMagic Awakened has **elements of many types of games.** Players don't pull the wheel to collect new characters like in Gacha games, but **every month there are a couple of Gacha items** that do entice players to gamble.\n\nGacha cosmetic items are **time-limited** to entice Fear of Missing Out (**FOMO**). F2P Players can, **and should**, ignore this aspect of the game, except for one thing: A powerful **P2Wand.**\n\nP2Wands are the only Gacha items in the game that grant significant gameplay advantages. Thankfully, there is a way to **win Gacha prizes for free.**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CV16o92.jpg)\n\n## P2Wands\n\u003e\"The wizard chooses the wand, Mr. Potter, and it's always clear why.\"\n\u003e‚Äî Harry Potter and the Disloyal Wand Bearer\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/DbAUsNz.jpg)\n\nOh, look, it sparkles! And it has a 15% Exploration Attribute?! SCORE! \n\nLet's just say Magic Awakened players are not the most loyal witches and wizards out there, even the Hupplepuffs. That **first wand** you acquire at Olivander's will be **gathering dust** at the bottom of your school trunk faster than you can say *Draco dormiens nunquam titillandus*.\n\nThere are a lot of wands in the game and most are money traps. Whales like to collect fancy wands but F2P Players should mostly focus on their attributes:\n\n* **Dueling Club Rescue Attempts:** The quintessential P2W element of Magic Awakened that gives you a big advantage in 2V2 PVP.\n* **Exploration Attributes:** Increases stats in PVE. The real P2W element of P2Wands, because it helps with the PVE grind for resources.\n* **MP Regen Speed:** Gives you an edge in challenging PVE scenarios. One may argue this is better than the bonus to Exploration Attributes.\n* **Collection Points:** The attribute of cosmetic items that allows you to upgrade your room to flex how many cosmetics you have. Mostly useless for F2P Players.\n* **Magic Proficiency Gained:** Allows you to gain cosmetics for your spells at a faster rate. 100% useless.\n\nMost P2Wands are locked behind **pay walls** (usually the Gacha Wheel) and demand a lot of resources to acquire. But **F2P Players can still get them.**\n\nWhat you really want is a wand with a **15% Exploration Attribute** bonus and an extra **Dueling Club Rescue Attempt.**\n\nDo not settle for anything less. **Save** resources like Gems and Clockturn Keys **until such a P2Wand is available on the Gacha Wheel.** Most wands F2P Players acquire should be free PVP or PVE rewards.\n\nWands are expensive. **Do not waste resources on crappy wands.**\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/ZGDMsHJ.jpg)\n\n## The Gacha Wheel üê≥\n\u003e\"Turns out he's in big trouble with the goblins. Borrowed loads of gold off them. A gang of them cornered him in the woods after the World Cup and took all the gold he had, and it still wasn't enough to cover all his debts. They followed him all the way to Hogwarts to keep an eye on him. He‚Äôs lost everything gambling.\"\n\u003e‚ÄîGambling is bad, kids\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/d9svSjq.jpg)\n\nDon't worry, **we have a system.** Ok, maybe worry a little bit. You can ignore most Gacha in Magic Awakened, but sooner or later **F2P Players** will be **tempted** by an item on the wheel.\n\nA F2P Player is advised to **touch the wheel for one thing**, and one thing only: **Power.** Something like a **P2Wand** with **15% Exploration Attributes** and 1 extra **Dueling Club Rescue Attempt.**\n\nThe wheel has a **pity system of 60 pulls (RIGHT, WARNERBROS?!).** Save enough resources for 60 pulls, and it's barely gambling ‚Äî **you will get the item you want.** If you're lucky and get the item soon, you would not have to save a lot for a future wheel.\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/JkZ0wWZ.png)\n\nThat was the good news, now the bad news: you need to save Gems to get those 60 pulls. Around **two months worth of free Gems** to buy **60 Clockturn Keys.** Worse news: The items on the **wheel change every month.** If you want it, but don't have enough Clockturn Keys for 60 pulls, you'd be tempted to transfigure into a **whale** üê≥\n\nYou either have enough for 60 pulls, or you move on. There will be similar items in future wheels. **Patience is key (pun intended).** Now the worst news: **This is (like) gambling.** Gambling is regulated for a good reason.\n\nYou need to **be cold about this aspect of Magic Awakened.** Never bet on luck. Do not touch the wheel without enough resources for 60 pulls. Be advised that whales consider between **40 and 50 pulls for an item to be average.**\n\nSome people have spent well over $10,000 on this game chasing **time-limited** cosmetics. **There is a pity system, not a generosity system.** The odds are stacked against you. Be careful.\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/JGiCwwm.png)\n\n# 6. You Shall Not Crave Thy Neighbor's Cosmetics\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/EAhXEOX.png)\n\nGood resource management skills would allow you to collect a variety of cosmetics, including some premium ones. There is an opportunity-cost for doing so: **you would have to spend resources you could otherwise spend on power.**\n\nThe **social aspects of Magic Awakened can put some pressure on you** to chase cosmetics. Dolphins and whales have access to some cool stuff, but this is not an area of the game where F2P Players can compete.\n\nThe **grind for power can get boring**, and combined with the inevitable frustration you will (eventually) experience with PVP, you may prefer to **focus on cosmetics to continue having fun.**\n\nTaking a **break from the game** or finding **other ways to have fun** is **better for your progress**, but investing in cosmetics can be fun too. In the end, having fun is the most important thing. **The choice is yours.**\n\n## F2P Vs Whale Cosmetics üê≥\n\u003e\"He was holding up something that looked to Harry like a long, maroon velvet dress. It had a moldy-looking lace frill at the collar and matching lace cuffs. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got to be kidding,‚Äù said Ron in disbelief. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not wearing that, no way.‚Äù\n\u003e‚Äî F2P King complaining about F2P Cosmetics\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/96Vt6NV.jpg)\n\nCosmetics are not a (significant) Pay to Win element of Magic Awakened unless you want it to be. **It's possible for F2P Players to acquire many cosmetics,** but that does not mean you should. Whales are beautiful, you are not ‚Äî and you never will be. Whales are powerful, and you are not ‚Äî yet.\n\n**This guide** aims to give F2P Players a fighting chance against whales and veterans in **PVP Wizarding Duels.** That goal is entirely possible, but it benefits from a **Spartan-like playstyle**, so to speak. That means using your resources to gain power, not cosmetics.\n\nThis cannot be repeated often enough: the secret to survive as a F2P Player is **resource management.** Always. Most whale cosmetics can only be acquired using the **same resources you could spend on power.**\n\nThat said, **enjoyment of the game is more important than power.** If you are absolutely sure it is more fun to have **some** whale cosmetics instead of power: know that you can. \n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/GZKbhJh.jpg)\n\n## How F2P Players Buy Whale Cosmetics üê≥ \n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/RVh3FcX.jpg)\n\nMost cosmetics can be acquired using **Gems** or **Event Currencies.** You can **hoard** such resources and **wait for an opportunity.**\n\n**The best cosmetics are time-limited,** to generate **FOMO.** You will **not** be able to save enough resources **between the time a cosmetic appears and the time it disappears.**\n\nWhen you buy cosmetics, be sure it is something you really want, because **F2P Players cannot afford to buy cosmetics every month.**\n\nYou need time to hoard. It takes around **two months worth of saving gems** to buy 60 Clockturn Keys.\n\nAnd the initial advice remains: you should ignore cosmetics and **focus on power instead.**\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/3i0qWV7.jpg)\n\n## Collection Points üê≥\n\u003e\"'So, this is the F2P room?' said Ron, strolling over to a dingy door in the corner opposite the pantry. Harry had never seen it open. A nest-like jumbled pile of assorted rags and blankets with a small dent to show where F2P Players curl up to sleep every night.\"\n\u003e‚Äî Harry Potter and the Real State System\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/rIDEf6j.jpg)\n\nLike an abused house elf, you should wear your rags with pride. **Be thankful for whatever free cosmetic** you can get your filthy little hands upon.\n\nThe **Collection Attribute** you find in cosmetics has two functions: **to upgrade your Wizard Space (room)** and buff your **Exploration Attributes.**\n\nOnce you have enough Collection Points, your Wizard Space is upgraded. **Each upgrade makes your room larger and gives you access to more decorations** to show off your fashion sense and interior decoration skills.\n\nA bonus to Exploration Attribute is very good for resource gathering, but **cosmetics are too expensive.** You could spend all your Gold, all your Gems, and your entire bank account, and the only **gameplay advantage** you'd have in return is **that bonus.**\n\nIt's a decent bonus, but **you could upgrade a lot of cards using the same resources.** Collection Points are too costly, so you should **ignore cosmetics if your focus is PVP.** \n\nYour room will **grow slowly with F2P cosmetics** anyway. Give preference to Cosmetics with **High Collection Points** to grow your room quicker.\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/jT4CduN.png)\n\n# 7. You Shall Hoard Like a Dragon \n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/Uog6df6.jpg)\n\n**There are many resources.** It can be confusing, but it's easy once you understand the **true cost of power** in Magic Awakened. Resources lead to power. Always.\n\nInvoke your inner Smaug and hoard. **Hoarding resources is the key to success** (most of the time). The true cost of most good things is **hidden from you** at the start.\n\n**Cheap** things are **rarely worth** the price. Fall for temptation, and the game will slowly deplete your hoard. **When you need** resources for something expensive, it's too late: **you're poor.**\n\nMost of the time it's best to hoard resources for **something expensive.** This guide gives you advice about **how to spend** your main resources.\n\nRemember the Dragon's Rule: **when in doubt, hoard it.**\n\n## Gold\n\u003e‚ÄúMust be nice, to have so much money you don‚Äôt notice if a pocketful of Galleons goes missing.‚Äù\n\u003e‚Äî Ron \"F2P King\" Weasley\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/82CaNV7.png)\n\nYou will not have enough Gold to **fully upgrade Cards and Echos.** This is the most common resource in Magic Awakened, and you have a **Daily Cap of 1200 Gold Coins.**\n\nThe Gold cap seems like enough at first, but upgrades have an **exponential cost.** The **true cost of upgrades** is hidden from you.\n\nThis does not mean F2P Players need to spend as little Gold as Our King, but it does mean **you should not spend like a Malfoy on a shopping spree**. \n\nA Common Daily Offer of low-cost useful things can add up to 1134 Gold Coins **(94.5% of your Daily Cap)**. This could still be worth it, but it is not a no-brainer.\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/2uv7s7m.png)\n\nTake a similar offer every day, and you will **not be able to hoard Gold** for when things start to get expensive.\n\nIt takes **47000 Gold Coins to upgrade one card to Level 15.** If you hit your **Daily Cap of Gold every day** (no easy task) and resist the temptation to spend any of it (unlikely), it would still take **40 DAYS** to upgrade one card. One. Card. There are 11 cards in a deck. And you'd still need all the necessary **Card Duplicates.**\n\nIt's best to understand the **true value of a Gold Coin** as soon as possible. Gold scarcity pushes many players to **abandon** the game, or **embrace the dark side (üê≥).** \n\nNow the good news: you do have **sources of Gold outside of your Daily Cap**, and there are a lot of fun things to do in Magic Awakened besides hoarding.\n\nJust remember to save **most** of your Gold for **card upgrades** and **plenty** of Gold for **Echo upgrades.**\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/ICEDCzC.jpg)\n\n## Gems\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/0FC81QQ.jpg)\n\nThe amount of ways you can **waste your Gems** is frankly absurd. This is the premium F2P Currency. The paid currency, **Starstone**, has a **1 to 1 trade value with Gems.**\n\nYou will often **wonder** if something is worth the asking Gem price, and **that is by design.** Gem offers are **whale traps** meant to entice players to spend **real money** in the game. Gems are **extremely valuable for F2P Players.**\n\nYou can put Gem expenses in **three buckets,** each demanding **different considerations.**\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/laVwysX.jpg)\n\n### Random Card Packs\n* Daily Pack Offers\n* Chest/ Charms Research\n* Library\n\n**Card Duplicates** are the **most important resource**, but that **does not** mean you should simply spend all your Gems on **Card Packs.**\n\n**Big events** will offer **better Card Pack Offers** with improved **Legendary** odds. **Hoard** most of your Gems for **special offers** instead of **regular offers.**\n\n### Lucky Offers\n* Duplicate Packs\n* Trade Coin Offers\n* Top Potions and Ingredients\n\nYou need **experience** to know when an offer is **worth the price.** Duplicate Packs for cards in your main **Meta Deck** are usually worth the asking price.\n\n**Trade Coins** are **just as good** as Duplicate Packs, but the **asking price** may be too high. **Top Potions** are usually **too expensive**, but not always.\n\n### Whale Bait\n* 60 Clockturn Keys\n* Cosmetics and Wands\n* Basic Resources: Echo Crystals, Gold, Echos, Most Potions, etc.\n\n**Everything** is whale bait, but some things more than others. F2P Players benefit from whale bait from time to time, but should **spend as little as possible** on it.\n\nThe quintessential baits are **Clockturn Keys, wands, and cosmetics.** F2P Players **should** spin the **Gacha Wheel** at least **once**, but not much more than that.\n\nSome **basic resources** are tempting, but using Gems to acquire them is **usually a bad idea** even with low prices. Your Gems will **slowly deplete** if you do that.\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/3V3sJVx.jpg)\n\n## Clockturn Keys\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/SHp6HM8.png)\n\n**Sixty** is the magic number (right, WarnerBros?). You can find Clockturn Keys in PVE or buy each for **200 Gems** (right, WarnerBros?).\n\nThis is the resource whales value the most, this is the resource used in the **Gacha Wheel.** Some whales spend **hundreds of dollars** to have 60 Clockturn Keys **every month** and spin that wheel. Don't use a single key without having **enough Gems for 60** of them.\n\nClockturn Keys are very valuable resources. As a F2P Player, Clockturn Keys are even more valuable, because **collecting 60 of them will not be easy.**\n\nBe very, very, very, very, very, very careful not to spin the wheel unless you are **absolutely sure** you need an item from it. **Items change every month.**\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/SdULM6G.png)\n\n## Echo Crystals\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/Xk5cE9D.png)\n\nEcho Crystals are similar to Gold. It's not a premium currency, but **you need a great amount of it.** Legendary Echos are **more expensive** than low grade Echos, but they are **more powerful.**\n\nThe longer you can resist spending Echo Crystals, the better. Ideally, you'd only use Echo Crystals to upgrade **Good Legendary Echos.**\n\nThe game will **tempt you to upgrade bad Echos** early on, wasting Gold and Echo Crystals. This could **tempt you to use Gems** to acquire more Gold, and **Starstones to Acquire Gems.**\n\nYou get the idea. Echos Crystals are used to **tempt you to the dark side (üê≥).** Be smart, do not waste them.\n\n**Do not use Gems** to upgrade Echos, but **do use bad Echos** when you lack enough Echo Crystals.\n\n## Event Currency\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/LIDjFRZ.png)\n\nThere are many events in the game, especially during festivities like **Halloween** and **Christmas.** During an event, **event currency** is used as reward.\n\nThe most important thing to remember about event currency is to **spend it before the event is over.** Once the event is over that currency is **useless or swapped** for common resources.\n\nYou need to **hoard** the event currency to afford the **best rewards.** It's **better** to spend event currency **near the end** of an event, so you can buy the **best rewards you can afford.**\n\nOnce an event is about to end, **spend it all even if you failed** to gather enough.\n\n## Potions \u0026 Ingredients\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/w745bA6.png)\n\nPotions are **not necessary**, but can be **useful.** There are many potions in the game, and gathering **ingredients** to brew them will demand a lot of **grind.**\n\nSome potions are good but **too hard to brew.** Potions are more useful when they can be **used often.** You can benefit from **hoarding** potions for opportune moments.\n\nDifferent players value different things, so the best potions are a **matter of opinion.** Some players **don't brew potions at all.**\n\nThis guide values **resources** above most things, so the **six best potions** listed here are **ranked** based on that criterion.\n\n### 1. Wit-sharpening Potion\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XweT0a9.png)\n\nThis is arguably the **best potion in the game.** Climb to a high enough rank and most players start to use strong **Meta Decks** with at least a couple of **Legendary Cards** in it. \n\nYou have a **9% chance** of copying any card in your opponents' deck, including their Legendary Cards. These are the **best Legendary odds in the game.**\n\nOne Legendary Card? **9%** chance of copy. Two? **18%.** Three? **27%.**\n\n### 2. Draught of Perception\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9BdJCZt.png)\n\nThe usefulness of this potion is self evident. The fact it **benefits an entire team** is a great advantage. Players with a **regular team** will **greatly benefit** from this potion.\n\n### 3. Wiggenweld Potion\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/lGxqSmW.png)\n\nHarder quests grant the best rewards. This potion makes **grind more efficient** and benefits an entire **team.** Teams can **take turns** using this potion to increase benefits and **split ingredient costs.**\n\n### 4. Memory Potion\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nrETdcZ.png)\n\nThis potion comes in **three sizes,** and the effect varies accordingly. Echo and Echo Crystals are very valuable, making this potion particularly useful **when Legendary Echos are more abundant.**\n\n### 5. Strengthening Solution\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qzVNma6.png)\n\nThis potion is similar to the Wiggenweld Potion, and makes **grind more efficient.** Only **high level players** will greatly **benefit** from this potion, but it's a great **source of extra resources.**\n\n### 6. Draught of Peace\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/20jLrfa.png)\n\nThis is the **most powerful potion** in the game, **many players only brew this.** Do yourself a favor: **don't use it** (most of the time).\n\nYou want the Dueling Hall **rewards**, but it's better to get them by **gaining power** instead of using **this crutch.**\n\nThe more you rely on this, the greater the **power gap** between you and your adversaries become. This potion will accelerate your journey towards the **Matchmaking Wall.**\n\nThat said, the **Draught of Peace** can be very useful when **Dueling Season is about to end.** You can use this potion to get **PVP Season Rewards in time.**\n\n## Thank You Letters\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/MU0PbJp.jpg)\n\nF2P Players and whales, friends at last! Players gain 'Thank You Letters' by helping others in **co-op Forbidden Forest (PVE).** This allows weak players to face **difficult PVE scenarios**, and strong players to collect this valuable resource. It's **win-win.**\n\nCollecting letters demands a lot of **grind**, but it's **worth it.** Over time, F2P Players can benefit a lot from this. Team **Trade Tokens** and **Card Packs** are very decent rewards. Although some rewards **may be overpriced** (50 letters for 1 Trade Token is a lot).\n\nSome **potions** and other items may be offered over time, and their **value will vary.** Some events may use 'Thank You Letters' too, so **hoarding** them might be a good idea.\n\nYou can never have too many 'Thank You Letters.' **The more, the merrier.**\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/RFcyQqg.png)\n\n## Trade Coins, Wild Cards \u0026 Duplicate Packs\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/cSHPsi1.png)\n\nTrade Coins allow you to **trade** cards of specific rarity and Wild Cards function as **Card Duplicates** for **any card** of that rarity. **Duplicate Packs** are occasional offers of **specific** cards.\n\nYou have some **limits on Trade Coin amounts**, meaning you **have to use them** as soon as you can **to find more.**\n\nYou need a lot of **Card Duplicates** to acquire **Level 15 Cards.** For the most part, you have no control over which Card Duplicates you get, which is why Coins, Wild Cards, and Duplicate Packs are so useful. **They allow you to choose.**\n\nOnce you choose a Meta Deck you like, you will have a **list of priority cards to upgrade.** These are the cards you use almost **any amount of resources** to upgrade.\n\nTrade Coins and Wild Cards **don't need to be hoarded**, but they should be **used well.** Use them on your preferred Meta Deck as soon as you can.\n\n## Star $tones üê≥\n\u003e\"The surfaces had all been draped in lacy covers and paid outfits. There were several vases full of dried flowers, each one residing on its own doily, and on one of the walls was a collection of ornamental plates, each decorated with a large technicolor Gacha kitten wearing a different bow around its neck. These were so foul that the player stared at them, transfixed, until the whale entered the dueling hall holding a P2Wand.\"\n\u003e‚Äî How it feels like too find a whale in PVP\n\nYou can buy Starstones with real money. My advice if you decide to buy those pink abominations is to spend it all on fabulous cosmetics and never, ever, play dueling matches against me. Lord Voldemort put a terrible curse on such duelists. You have been warned.\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/IWO0CIL.jpg)\n\n# 8. You Shall Use Meta Decks\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/dCn8CQz.jpg)\n\nUnlike many Collectible Card Games (CCG), you can acquire every card in this game in a reasonable amount of time, for free. **There are not that many cards**, since this is not a typical CCG.\n\n**There are no P2W or F2P decks in Magic Awakened.** That said, **fully upgrading cards is difficult.** This fact makes a **few decks more F2P-friendly** than others ‚Äî for a variety of reasons that will be covered in this section.\n\nThis is not a guide about specific decks, so it will **not enter into great detail** about any of them. This is just general advice for **F2P Players to choose suitable Meta Decks.**\n\nThe **meta is ever changing**, and varies by PVP rank, but over time you'll learn **what are the Meta Decks.**\n\n## Dobby Avada: The Whale Hunter\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/CmlXIce.png)\n\nWant to navigate the whale-infested waters of Top Rank Dueling? A Dobby Avada Deck is your best choice. The mighty whale may be bigger, stronger, and healthier than you, but a whale is only mortal, and all mortals fall before Lord Vol‚Äî hem, hem ‚ÄîDobby! **This is the best deck to use against higher level opponents (üê≥).**\n\nDo not mistake this for an overpowered deck. **A Dobby Avada Deck comes with important caveats**:\n\n1. This is not a beginner-friendly deck\n2. This is not good in Duo Duels (2V2)\n3. This deck struggles against some Meta Decks\n\n**Avada Kavadra** allows you to **ignore the extra HP** your opponent has over you and **Dobby's Echo Ability** is used to avoid their **superior damage output.** Dobby's teleport will put you in the **best position** to hit them with the unforgivable curse.\n\nThose are the **basics** of how the Dobby Avada Deck functions.\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/5LSKHrL.png)\n\n## Spell Vs Summon Vs Mixed Decks\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/GUXyONG.jpg)\n\nSo you tried Dobby Avada and hated it? Don't worry, **you still have options.** Worse options, true, but still good options.\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/cLisBPO.png)\n\n**Summon Decks are very beginner-friendly.** Summon Decks feel amazing early on because duelists still have weak basic attacks and are easily overwhelmed by **summon mobs.**\n\nSummons have one big advantage over spells: they are **easy** to use for both attack and defense. That said, compared to spells, **most summons cause less damage per point of mana spent.**\n\nSummon Decks can still be very powerful at the highest ranks, but your chances to win are very level-dependent. **F2P Players should not focus on Summon Decks**, at least not in the long term.\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/HoC48nQ.png)\n\n**Spell Decks are the most popular among veterans.** Spells can be very powerful and versatile, especially when taking Echo effects into consideration. It will be harder to win early on with Spell Decks, but the experience will make you **stronger in the long term.**\n\nSpells have two big **disadvantages**: it's easy to waste a spell, and it's hard to balance between attack and defense. The more you know about the game, the easier it will be to use spells correctly. **Spell Decks are the best for F2P Players.**\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/iWp7b3p.png)\n\n**Mixed Decks can be just as powerful as Spell Decks.** Such decks are based on Echos that benefit from mixing spell cards with specific summon cards. It's great for players who like summon cards but worry that pure Summon Decks are not powerful enough.\n\nThe biggest problem of Summon Decks for F2P Players is that summon cards **do not scale well with upgrades.** Adopting a Mixed Deck might help with that problem. You can focus on upgrading only **very specific summon cards** to build an effective deck.\n\n**F2P Players should play Mixed Decks if they like them more than Spell Decks.** There are no P2W Decks, so you can play anything you like. But upgrades are costly, so you should find a **Meta Deck with a greater focus on spell cards.**\n\n# 9. You Shall Upgrade Strategically\n\u003e\"Ravenclaws are a bunch of nerds. You overthink everything.\"\n\u003e‚ÄîShut up.\n\nThere is a lot of **luck involved in resource allocation.** For the most part, you can't select what Card Duplicates you find.\n\nResources like **Gold** and **Gems**, on the other hand, are **yours to control.** Understanding your options is important in selecting what is best for you.\n\nThere are **three paths (strategies) for upgrading cards**, each with advantages and disadvantages:\n\n* **Fast path:** High Magic Book Level, Low Deck Level Average\n* **Regular path:** Medium Magic Book Level, Medium Deck Level Average\n* **Slow path:** High Magic Book Level, High Deck Level Average\n\nWhat you do is up to you. It is **too soon to claim there is an optimal strategy** to follow.\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/pxUxemG.png)\n\n## Why Upgrade Strategies Matters\n\u003e\"Your higher rank is the sum of a remainder of an unbalanced equation inherent to the programming of my deck. You are the eventuality of an anomaly, which despite my sincerest efforts I have been unable to eliminate from what is otherwise a harmony of mathematical precision.\"\n\u003e‚ÄîThe Architect: nerdiest Ravenclaw Duelist\n\nPlayers repeat the same complaint, from Magic Book Level 1 to Magic Book Level 99: the **Matchmaking System sucks.** The opponent always seems to have **cards a little bit stronger** than yours, at every level. Stronger cards generally signal a **higher Magic Book Level.** This is why you struggle (Matchmaking Wall).\n\nImagine both opponents have 1000 HP left and frequently use Expelliarmus. Your card at **Level 10** does 157 Damage, and his at **Level 14** does 207. It's only a **50 damage difference**, but it means you would need to hit the target **7 times** to win while he would need to hit you **5 times.** And you already **started the match with less HP.**\n\n**Small differences like that compound** over the duration of a match. You either lose, or win a very sweaty match. **Upgrading will not solve the Matchmaking problem**, nothing will, but **the way you upgrade cards may help (a little bit).**\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/G1bbd2x.jpg)\n\n## Fast: The \"Everything Goes\" Strategy\n\u003e\"Don't think, just do it.\"\n\u003e‚Äî Not a bad strategy, actually\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/6kuR9Hw.jpg)\n\nThis is what most players do: **upgrade cards as soon as they can to increase Magic Book Level, regardless of the card.** This is the fastest way to increase Magic Book Level.\n\nThe two barriers to upgrade cards are Gold and Card Duplicates. You can hoard Gold, but **you have no control over which Card Duplicates you find.** So by following this strategy you will mostly upgrade **low level cards** that demand **less resources.**\n\nYou will gain a lot of experience, but most from low level cards, meaning your **Deck Level Average will be low.**\n\nThis strategy is **very simple**, ideal for players who don't like to overthink things. You can just click the button **\"Upgrade All\"** every time you are able to do so.\n\n**Why this might be the best strategy:** The Matchmaking System does not take Magic Book or Card Level into consideration, only Dueling Rank. **Magic Book Level grants more power than Card Level**, so it might be better to have a high Magic Book Level even at the cost of low Card Level. \n\n## Regular: The \"Selective Upgrade\" Strategy\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/aYaQX1D.png)\n\nA common adage in this game is: **expensive equals better.** It is usually better to save resources for something expensive down the line, at the cost of something less expensive right now.\n\nMost of the time **you have enough Gold to upgrade at least a few low level cards.** The basic idea of this strategy is **avoiding that.**\n\nTo upgrade a card **from Level 10 to 15** you need to invest **86% of the Gold** and **89% of Duplicates** necessary to fully upgrade that card.\n\nThat's a lot of resources to spend on cards you **do not use**, or cards that **do not upgrade well** (like some utility cards).\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/Fei8doK.png)\n\nBesides avoiding some upgrades past Level 10, this strategy relies on **upgrade priority.** A basic upgrade priority is:\n\n1. Cards you use in your deck;\n2. Most expensive upgrades available;\n3. Cards bellow Level 10.\n\nTwo people with the **same Magic Book Level** can have **different Card Level averages** because one upgraded anything they could, **just to climb rank,** and the other was more selective.\n\n**Why this might be the best strategy:** A player sacrifices upgrade speed for a higher deck level average. This strategy trades upgrade speed for **resources necessary for expensive upgrades.** You end up with better cards.\n\n## Slow: The \"Blue Whale\" Strategy\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/wMVdx6P.png)\n\nThere is no evidence that anyone has successfully tried this so far. The \"Blue Whale Strategy\" is **100% hypothetical.**\n\nDo the math and you will realize that by **Magic Book Level 40** (111,500 Total Exp) you could already have a **full deck of Level 15 cards.** In practice, a player with **Magic Book Level 70** would be **lucky to have even a couple** of Level 15 cards.\n\nThis happens because players **upgrade dozens of cards** to gain experience, even though you **only need eleven cards in a deck.** But what if you only upgraded cards you use?\n\nImagine you play the game for years, or you put so much money in the game that **resources are no longer a concern.** That would make the Blue Whale strategy possible. You'd only invest in inferior cards **once the ones you use are fully upgraded.**\n\nThe problem, of course, is that most players would take a lot of time between upgrades. Most card duplicates you find **would not be useful for a long time.**\n\n**Why this might be the best strategy:** this is the mathematically optimal use of resources. The only reason why most players invest in cards they never use is because they lack the resources to do otherwise, or they want to upgrade their Magic Book.\n\n# 10. You Shall Not Pass üßôüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/mG01rSJ.png)\n\nYes, this commandment is just a nerdy **joke.** Made for **fun.**\n\n**Burnout** will destroy you. A game needs to be fun, so if it's not fun anymore, **take a break.**\n\nThe one advantage F2P Players have over whales is **reduced FOMO.** A limited-time cosmetic **means nothing** to you.\n\nYes, you will fall further behind by playing less, but **F2P Players are always behind anyway.** You play the long game.\n\nThis game is amazing, but **PVE** content will **run out** and **PVP will get frustrating.** The **Matchmaking Wall** is inevitable.\n\nCome back when **new PVE content is added**, new **Dueling Season** begins. Maybe help improve this guide for F2P Players ( *wink, wink* ).\n\n**Don't bang your head against the wall.**\n\n## The Whale \u0026 the F2P Player\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/hqZTq9e.jpg)\n\nA Whale was making fun of the F2P Player one day for being so weak.\n\n\"Will you ever reach Hall of Fame?\" she asked with a mocking laugh.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the F2P Player, \"and I get there sooner than you think. I'll run you a race and prove it.\"\n\nThe Whale was much amused at the idea of running a race with the F2P Player, but for the fun of the thing she agreed. So Warner Bros Games who had consented to act as judge, launched a new Dueling Season and started the duelers off.\n\nThe Whale soon reached a score of 7400 points at the Dueling Club, and to make the F2P Player feel very deeply how ridiculous it was for him to try a race with a Whale, she took a break from the game until the F2P Player should catch up.\n\nThe F2P Player meanwhile kept getting stronger slowly but steadily, and, after a time, passed the rank of the Whale at the Dueling Club. But the Whale was still on a break; and when at last she decided to play again, the F2P Player was very near the Hall of Fame. The Whale then spent an extra $500 on the game, and reached Hall of Fame before the F2P Player anyway.\n\nMoral of the story: The whale usually wins.\n\n**The End.**\n\n![600](https://i.imgur.com/6SGhbU1.jpg)\n\n# Resources Every Player Should Know About\n* [Magic Awakened Discord (Fan Server)](https://discord.gg/harry-potter-magic-awakened-769046926825750538)\n* [Magic Awakened Discord (Official Server)](https://discord.gg/harrypottermagicawakened)\n* [Magic Awakened Database](awakened-db.com)\n* [Gorou's Cheat Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12EwLWrgKqqKUhiBkZzKyK0RVNHT5CUHQh6geWi4z0M4/edit#gid=0)\n\n## YouTube Channels\nThere are some great Magic Awakened YouTube Channels.
