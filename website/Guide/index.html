This is affected by your Magic Book and Echo Bonus.</li><li><strong>Attack:</strong> Indicates your basic attack power. This is affected by your Magic Book and Echo Bonus.</li><li><strong>Luck:</strong> Increases your odds of finding Legendary Cards. This is affected by unique items in the game.</li><li><strong>Exploration Attributes:</strong> Increases your stats in PVE, helping you gather resources. This is affected by your Magic Book Bonus and certain items in the game.</li></ul><p>To upgrade your cards you need resources. <strong>Whales</strong> and <strong>veterans</strong> are powerful because they had access to more resources than you.

Even <strong>F2P Players can collect all cards in a few weeks.</strong> Finding Card Duplicates is the real challenge.</p><p>Every time you find new cards there is (usually) <strong>less than 1% chance</strong> of finding the <strong>exact card</strong> you want. The more common a card is, the more Card Duplicates of that <strong>exact card</strong> you will need.</p><p>And even so: It is (arguably) <strong>more difficult to find 32 Legendary Card Duplicates than 1177 Common Card Duplicates.</strong></p><p>Magic Awakened players will lust over <strong>Legendary Card Duplicates</strong> about as often as Bellatrix lusts over Voldemort.</p><p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/h6RXL9z.jpg width=auto alt=600></p><a href=#echo-system><h2 id=echo-system><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Echo System</h2></a><p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Kti5v25.jpg width=auto alt=600></p><p>An Echo is the <strong>heart of a deck.</strong> Each Echo has a <strong>special ability</strong> based on a character from the Harry Potter universe, and grants a <strong>bonus to HP</strong>, <strong>attack</strong>, and <strong>specific cards</strong> in a deck.</p><p>What makes a card good or bad is <strong>how much it suits the Echo</strong> used in a deck.</p><p>Question: <strong>How many resources</strong> would you need to acquire <strong>Good Max Level Legendary Echos?</strong> Answer: <strong>Yes.</strong></p><p>The game will happily encourage you to throw everything <strong>and the kitchen sink</strong> at this black hole.

Here is a list of ocean dwellers, <strong>ranked from harmless to scariest:</strong></p><p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/9Z3lmdP.png width=auto alt=600></p><p><strong>F2P Players</strong> do not spend money in the game. At most you bought the Battle Pass once or twice. If players are sea creatures, you are like a krill — the creature whales feed upon. There are a ton of us in the game, and nobody cares when a single one dies 💀</p><p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/I5iZCV9.png width=auto alt=600></p><p><strong>Dolphins</strong> spend a decent amount of money in the game. A dolphin may buy the Battle Pass often, and many cosmetics. Dolphins do have access to more resources than F2P Players, but not by much. Dolphins are like F2P Players with prettier outfits.</p><p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/IXMt03l.png width=auto alt=600></p><p><strong>Whales</strong> spend a lot of money in the game. Like a dolphin, whales tend to spend most extra resources on cosmetics. Whales are stronger than F2P Players, but a few days on a break from the game would close that power gap.</p><p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/uGsQobU.png width=auto alt=600></p><p><strong>Blue whales</strong> are not like most whales. Most whales do the math and realize it would be insane to pay for a High Magic Book Level. Blue whales follow the P2W Code. Blue whales are like veterans without the skill.</p><p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/73wN4Ny.png width=auto alt=600></p><p><strong>F2P or Dolphin Veterans</strong> are the reason why so many people argue the game is not P2W.

A veteran is like an Orca — not really a whale, but only experts can tell the difference.</p><p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/jYYjeSI.png width=auto alt=600></p><p><strong>Veteran Whales</strong> are whales that play as much as veterans. How do you catch up? You don&rsquo;t. The difference in power between veterans and veteran whales is not huge, but it does exist.

Most whale cosmetics can only be acquired using the <strong>same resources you could spend on power.</strong></p><p>That said, <strong>enjoyment of the game is more important than power.</strong> If you are absolutely sure it is more fun to have <strong>some</strong> whale cosmetics instead of power: know that you can.</p><p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/GZKbhJh.jpg width=auto alt=600></p><a href=#how-f2p-players-buy-whale-cosmetics-><h2 id=how-f2p-players-buy-whale-cosmetics-><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>How F2P Players Buy Whale Cosmetics 🐳</h2></a><p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/RVh3FcX.jpg width=auto alt=600></p><p>Most cosmetics can be acquired using <strong>Gems</strong> or <strong>Event Currencies.</strong> You can <strong>hoard</strong> such resources and <strong>wait for an opportunity.</strong></p><p><strong>The best cosmetics are time-limited,</strong> to generate <strong>FOMO.</strong> You will <strong>not</strong> be able to save enough resources <strong>between the time a cosmetic appears and the time it disappears.</strong></p><p>When you buy cosmetics, be sure it is something you really want, because <strong>F2P Players cannot afford to buy cosmetics every month.</strong></p><p>You need time to hoard. It takes around <strong>two months worth of saving gems</strong> to buy 60 Clockturn Keys.</p><p>And the initial advice remains: you should ignore cosmetics and <strong>focus on power instead.</strong></p><p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/3i0qWV7.jpg width=auto alt=600></p><a href=#collection-points-><h2 id=collection-points-><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Collection Points 🐳</h2></a><blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;So, this is the F2P room?&rsquo; said Ron, strolling over to a dingy door in the corner opposite the pantry.

You can hoard Gold, but <strong>you have no control over which Card Duplicates you find.</strong> So by following this strategy you will mostly upgrade <strong>low level cards</strong> that demand <strong>less resources.</strong></p><p>You will gain a lot of experience, but most from low level cards, meaning your <strong>Deck Level Average will be low.</strong></p><p>This strategy is <strong>very simple</strong>, ideal for players who don&rsquo;t like to overthink things. You can just click the button <strong>&ldquo;Upgrade All&rdquo;</strong> every time you are able to do so.</p><p><strong>Why this might be the best strategy:</strong> The Matchmaking System does not take Magic Book or Card Level into consideration, only Dueling Rank. <strong>Magic Book Level grants more power than Card Level</strong>, so it might be better to have a high Magic Book Level even at the cost of low Card Level.</p><a href=#regular-the-selective-upgrade-strategy><h2 id=regular-the-selective-upgrade-strategy><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Regular: The &ldquo;Selective Upgrade&rdquo; Strategy</h2></a><p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/aYaQX1D.png width=auto alt=600></p><p>A common adage in this game is: <strong>expensive equals better.</strong> It is usually better to save resources for something expensive down the line, at the cost of something less expensive right now.</p><p>Most of the time <strong>you have enough Gold to upgrade at least a few low level cards.</strong> The basic idea of this strategy is <strong>avoiding that.</strong></p><p>To upgrade a card <strong>from Level 10 to 15</strong> you need to invest <strong>86% of the Gold</strong> and <strong>89% of Duplicates</strong> necessary to fully upgrade that card.</p><p>That&rsquo;s a lot of resources to spend on cards you <strong>do not use</strong>, or cards that <strong>do not upgrade well</strong> (like some utility cards).</p><p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/Fei8doK.png width=auto alt=600></p><p>Besides avoiding some upgrades past Level 10, this strategy relies on <strong>upgrade priority.</strong> A basic upgrade priority is:</p><ol><li>Cards you use in your deck;</li><li>Most expensive upgrades available;</li><li>Cards bellow Level 10.</li></ol><p>Two people with the <strong>same Magic Book Level</strong> can have <strong>different Card Level averages</strong> because one upgraded anything they could, <strong>just to climb rank,</strong> and the other was more selective.</p><p><strong>Why this might be the best strategy:</strong> A player sacrifices upgrade speed for a higher deck level average. This strategy trades upgrade speed for <strong>resources necessary for expensive upgrades.</strong> You end up with better cards.</p><a href=#slow-the-blue-whale-strategy><h2 id=slow-the-blue-whale-strategy><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Slow: The &ldquo;Blue Whale&rdquo; Strategy</h2></a><p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/wMVdx6P.png width=auto alt=600></p><p>There is no evidence that anyone has successfully tried this so far. The &ldquo;Blue Whale Strategy&rdquo; is <strong>100% hypothetical.</strong></p><p>Do the math and you will realize that by <strong>Magic Book Level 40</strong> (111,500 Total Exp) you could already have a <strong>full deck of Level 15 cards.</strong> In practice, a player with <strong>Magic Book Level 70</strong> would be <strong>lucky to have even a couple</strong> of Level 15 cards.</p><p>This happens because players <strong>upgrade dozens of cards</strong> to gain experience, even though you <strong>only need eleven cards in a deck.</strong> But what if you only upgraded cards you use?</p><p>Imagine you play the game for years, or you put so much money in the game that <strong>resources are no longer a concern.</strong> That would make the Blue Whale strategy possible. You&rsquo;d only invest in inferior cards <strong>once the ones you use are fully upgraded.</strong></p><p>The problem, of course, is that most players would take a lot of time between upgrades. Most card duplicates you find <strong>would not be useful for a long time.</strong></p><p><strong>Why this might be the best strategy:</strong> this is the mathematically optimal use of resources. The only reason why most players invest in cards they never use is because they lack the resources to do otherwise, or they want to upgrade their Magic Book.</p><a href=#you-shall-not-pass-><h1 id=you-shall-not-pass-><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>You Shall Not Pass 🧙🏻‍♂️</h1></a><p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/mG01rSJ.png width=auto alt=600></p><p>Yes, this commandment is just a nerdy <strong>joke.</strong> Made for <strong>fun.</strong></p><p><strong>Burnout</strong> will destroy you. A game needs to be fun, so if it&rsquo;s not fun anymore, <strong>take a break.</strong></p><p>The one advantage F2P Players have over whales is <strong>reduced FOMO.</strong> A limited-time cosmetic <strong>means nothing</strong> to you.</p><p>Yes, you will fall further behind by playing less, but <strong>F2P Players are always behind anyway.</strong> You play the long game.</p><p>This game is amazing, but <strong>PVE</strong> content will <strong>run out</strong> and <strong>PVP will get frustrating.</strong> The <strong>Matchmaking Wall</strong> is inevitable.</p><p>Come back when <strong>new PVE content is added</strong>, new <strong>Dueling Season</strong> begins.

I&rsquo;ll run you a race and prove it.&rdquo;</p><p>The Whale was much amused at the idea of running a race with the F2P Player, but for the fun of the thing she agreed. So Warner Bros Games who had consented to act as judge, launched a new Dueling Season and started the duelers off.</p><p>The Whale soon reached a score of 7400 points at the Dueling Club, and to make the F2P Player feel very deeply how ridiculous it was for him to try a race with a Whale, she took a break from the game until the F2P Player should catch up.</p><p>The F2P Player meanwhile kept getting stronger slowly but steadily, and, after a time, passed the rank of the Whale at the Dueling Club. But the Whale was still on a break; and when at last she decided to play again, the F2P Player was very near the Hall of Fame. The Whale then spent an extra $500 on the game, and reached Hall of Fame before the F2P Player anyway.</p><p>Moral of the story: The whale usually wins.</p><p><strong>The End.</strong></p><p><img src=https://i.imgur.com/6SGhbU1.jpg width=auto alt=600></p><a href=#resources-every-player-should-know-about><h1 id=resources-every-player-should-know-about><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Resources Every Player Should Know About</h1></a><ul><li><a href=https://discord.gg/harry-potter-magic-awakened-769046926825750538 rel=noopener>Magic Awakened Discord (Fan Server)</a></li><li><a href=https://discord.gg/harrypottermagicawakened rel=noopener>Magic Awakened Discord (Official Server)</a></li><li><a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=awakened-db.com>Magic Awakened Database</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12EwLWrgKqqKUhiBkZzKyK0RVNHT5CUHQh6geWi4z0M4/edit#gid=0" rel=noopener>Gorou&rsquo;s Cheat Sheet</a></li></ul><a href=#youtube-channels><h2 id=youtube-channels><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>YouTube Channels</h2></a><p>There are some great Magic Awakened YouTube Channels.
